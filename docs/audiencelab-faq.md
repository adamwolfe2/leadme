### 5fuJj2psGh37VtS1ECNF1H
<a id="activateTM-5fujj2psgh37vts1ecnf1h"></a>

Without a verified domain, your emails are far more likely to land in spam — or be blocked entirely.

Even though AudienceSend is an ESP, you still need your own domain for these reasons:

- “From” Domain: It controls the visible sender email (e.g. sarah@yourcompany.com)

- Deliverability: DNS records like SPF and DKIM authorize AudienceSend to send on your behalf — required by inbox providers

- Trust: Gmail, Outlook, etc., use your domain’s reputation to determine inbox vs. spam

- Branding: Recipients trust yourname@yourbrand.com more than a generic shared domain

- Compliance: Gmail and Yahoo block non-authenticated traffic starting in 2024

```plain
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:audiencesend.com ~all

Type: TXT
Host: audiencesend._domainkey
Value: (DKIM key provided)

Type: CNAME
Host: bounce
Value: return.audiencesend.com
```

1. Go to your DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

4. Click Verify in AudienceSend — once complete, you’ll see a Verified status

### How to Add Suppression Lists in AudienceSend
<a id="activateTM-how-to-add-suppression-lists-in-audiencesend"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/2---load-your-list-/5fuJj2psGemmLPXu8sudvU

Before you can send any emails, you need to upload or sync your target contacts into AudienceSend. You can do this manually via CSV or automatically via webhook integration (e.g., Make.com or Zapier) \*coming soon.

8. You need to choose a segment or tag for this upload (e.g., “Cold List - July”)

After upload, you’ll see a confirmation screen and can view the contacts under `Contacts > View Contacts`.

A **suppression list** is a safety filter that tells AudienceSend **who not to email under any circumstance**, even if those contacts are accidentally added to a campaign.

- It's a list of email addresses or domains that are blocked from receiving messages

Messaging unsubscribed users
Re-emailing past customers
Accidentally reaching competitors or internal test accounts

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Benefit | Description |
| Compliance | Helps you follow GDPR, CAN-SPAM, TCPA, etc. |
| Brand Safety | Prevents messaging sensitive groups or competitors |
| List Quality | Ensures you're not wasting sends on disengaged or opted-out users |
| Performance | Avoids hurting deliverability by re-emailing bounced or spam-reported addresses |

3. Choose **Email Address** or **Domain-Level Suppression**

5. Save — AudienceSend will now automatically filter out these emails from **all future sends**, even if you try to import or trigger them into a campaign

- Suppress your own internal company domain to avoid test emails slipping through

- Suppress recent customers or low-fit segments to avoid overlap

#### Understanding Lists, Segments, and Tags

AudienceSend gives you three powerful tools to manage and organize your contacts: **Lists**, **Segments**, and **Tags**. Each plays a different role in how you group, filter, and target your audience.

A **List** is a static group of contacts you upload or sync into AudienceSend.

- Think of a list as a spreadsheet or file of people you’re uploading together

- Lists don’t change unless you manually add/remove contacts

- Great for cold uploads, ad exports, or lead magnet opt-ins

- Need to segment audiences by how they were acquired

A **Segment** is a saved filter that dynamically groups contacts based on behavior, metadata, or status.

- You create them by applying filters like: “Has opened an email in last 7 days,” “Was tagged `warm_lead`,” etc.

- Segments are perfect for re-engagement or automation targeting

A **Tag** is a simple label you attach to a contact (or group of contacts) to track their status, source, or behavior.

- Tags are the most flexible tool for labeling contacts

- Mark contacts for inclusion/exclusion in future campaigns

- Trigger follow-ups based on actions (e.g., “tag if replied”)

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature | Static or Dynamic? | Editable? | Best For |
| **List** | Static | Manual | Uploading or grouping data sources |
| **Segment** | Dynamic | Filtered logic | Live audiences based on behavior |
| **Tag** | Flexible | Manual or Automated | Labeling by status, action, or source |

### If You're Sending Cold Emails (Recommended for Outreach)
<a id="activateTM-if-youre-sending-cold-emails-recommended-for-outreach"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/3---create-first-email/5fuJj2psGbD3p9QMEQADLG

Once your domain, sender profiles, and contact list are in place, you’re ready to send your first campaign using an **Email Blast**. This is where you define your audience, select lists or segments, and configure any exclusions or suppression logic.

You’ll now be prompted to configure the core settings for your campaign:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Field | Description |
| **Blast Name** | Internal-only name to identify this send (e.g., “July Cold Outreach – SaaS”) |
| **Suppression List (Optional)** | Choose a predefined suppression list to ensure these contacts never receive this blast |
| **Exclude List (Optional)** | Manually exclude specific lists of contacts from this blast |
| **Lists** | Select one or more contact lists to include (e.g., “Demo Leads”, “NY Prospects”) |
| **Segments** | Include specific segments you've tagged or filtered (e.g., “High Intent”, “Opted-in”, etc.) |
| **Exclude Segments (Optional)** | Prevent a segment (e.g., “Existing Clients”, “Past Replies”) from receiving this blast |

AudienceSend will only send the blast to users who:

- Exist in one of the selected **Lists** or **Segments**, and

- Are **not** in any of the excluded lists, segments, or suppression lists

2. You’ll be taken to the email editor where you can:

Now that you’ve selected your audience and clicked **Next**, it’s time to write the actual email that will be sent to your list.

This step is critical — how you structure your message can dramatically affect deliverability, response rate, and even whether your email reaches the inbox at all.

Cold emails must look personal, text-based, and authentic — as if you typed them yourself. To maximize deliverability:

- Write **short, clear sentences** that match natural human tone

- Use **line breaks** between paragraphs (no indentation or formatting)

- Keep your signature simple (just a name or name + title)

##### 🚫 Avoid These Deliverability Killers

- No HTML styling (bold/italic colors, tables, buttons)

- Merge tags like `{{first_name}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{sender_name}}`

```plain
Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} your team at {{company}} is hiring.
```

##### If You’re Sending Warm Emails or Newsletters

If you're emailing a **permission-based list** (like blog subscribers or customers), you can use richer formatting.

**HTML Editor** for developers
**Drag-and-Drop Builder** for design-friendly layout

- Use a single-column layout for mobile responsiveness

- Still avoid Bitly or link trackers unless AudienceSend handles them natively

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use Case | Editor to Use | Style |
| Cold Outreach | Plain Text (default) | No HTML, no images |
| Warm Newsletter | Drag-and-Drop or HTML | Clean, responsive layout |
| Reactivating Users | Plain Text | Looks like a personal email |

#### Code snippets

```
Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} your team at {{company}} is hiring.
```

### Using Spintax to Personalize Cold Emails
<a id="activateTM-using-spintax-to-personalize-cold-emails"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/4---generating-spintax/5fuJj2psGeq3nGWX3zUGxQ

Spintax helps make every email look unique — without writing dozens of variations manually.

AudienceSend supports Spintax in subject lines and body copy, so you can rotate language automatically and improve deliverability by avoiding duplicate content patterns.

Spintax stands for “spinning syntax.” It’s a way to write multiple versions of a word, phrase, or sentence using a single line of text. When the campaign sends, AudienceSend randomly selects one option for each contact.

Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} that {{company}} is growing.
```

Resulting in a natural-looking variation every time.

##### How the Spintax Token Generator Works

1. Place your cursor inside the subject or body field

2. Click the **Spintax Token Generator** icon (usually a `{}` symbol)

You can use multiple tokens across the email to spin greetings, verbs, closings, and even call-to-actions.

##### How to Generate Your Own Spintax (Manual or Free Tools)

If you prefer to control the phrasing yourself or want to generate variations externally:

##### Option 1: Use a Free Spintax Generator

##### Option 2: Use ChatGPT to Generate It

2. **Paste** it into ChatGPT (or any AI writing assistant).

3. **Replace**`[YOUR SERVICE OR OFFER]` and `[YOUR IDEAL AUDIENCE]` with your specifics.

4. **Submit** and get a spintax-formatted cold email template for use in your outreach platform.

Write a cold email template for [YOUR SERVICE OR OFFER], targeting [YOUR IDEAL AUDIENCE].

For each key phrase or sentence, give me 10-20 alternative variations in [option1|option2|option3|...] spintax format so I can use this email with a cold email sending platform.

Use merge tags like {{first_name}} or {{company_name}} where appropriate.

The final output should be a full cold email template, ready to copy and paste, using this spintax format throughout the email.
```

Write a cold email template for AI automation services, targeting small business owners.

For each key phrase or sentence, give me 10-20 alternative variations in [option1|option2|option3|...] spintax format so I can use this email with a cold email sending platform.

Use merge tags like {{first_name}} or {{company_name}} where appropriate.

The final output should be a full cold email template, ready to copy and paste, using this spintax format throughout the email.
```

- Use merge tags (e.g., `{{first_name}}`, `{{company_name}}`) for easy personalization.

- Most cold email tools (Instantly, Lemlist, Smartlead, etc.) accept this `[option1|option2|...]` spintax format.

#### Code snippets

```
{Option A|Option B|Option C}
```
```
Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} that {{company}} is growing.
```
```
{hello|hi|hey}
```
```
Write a cold email template for [YOUR SERVICE OR OFFER], targeting [YOUR IDEAL AUDIENCE].

For each key phrase or sentence, give me 10-20 alternative variations in [option1|option2|option3|...] spintax format so I can use this email with a cold email sending platform.

Example: [Hi|Hello|Hey there]

Use merge tags like {{first_name}} or {{company_name}} where appropriate.

The final output should be a full cold email template, ready to copy and paste, using this spintax format throughout the email.

### After Sending: Where to Track Performance
<a id="activateTM-after-sending-where-to-track-performance"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/5---sending-email-/5fuJj2psGd4HbmS8WQizU4

Once you’ve written and reviewed your email inside the Blast Editor, the final step is to either send it now or schedule it for later.

AudienceSend gives you both options, with full control over timing and delivery behavior.

1. After finalizing your email content, scroll to the bottom of the Blast Editor

- **Preview**: View the message exactly as it will appear

- AudienceSend will begin sending the campaign right away to your selected recipients

- Select a **future date and time** for the email to go out

- You can check the **Perfect Timing** box to let AudienceSend deliver each email when a recipient is most likely to open it — within a rolling 24-hour window based on past engagement patterns

Once your blast is scheduled or sent, you can monitor its status and results under:

- Click the three dots (⋮) to edit or manage each one

- Track performance metrics like opens, replies, clicks, and bounces

Before sending your blast to your actual list, it's best practice to send a test email to yourself or your team. This helps you confirm that formatting, links, personalization tokens, and layout all appear as expected — and lets you catch grammar or design errors early.

- Validates visual formatting (especially across email clients)

- Verifies that tokens like `{{first_name}}` and `{{company}}` render correctly

- Prevents deliverability or display issues caused by untested HTML or spintax

- Ensures your content is polished before it hits real inboxes

##### How to Send a Test Email in AudienceSend

5. Optionally, click the **"+" icon** to add additional email addresses for teammates or preview inboxes

You’ll receive a copy of the exact email that will go out — including subject, formatting, dynamic fields, and links — so you can check for issues before final scheduling or delivery.

### Build Automations to Trigger Personalized Sequences
<a id="activateTM-build-automations-to-trigger-personalized-sequences"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/6---automation-flows/5fuJj2psGbEt2qiv6Ybvan

Automations in AudienceSend allow you to create logic-based flows that trigger actions like sending emails, tagging contacts, waiting between steps, or routing users based on behavior. You can use automations to send follow-ups, onboard new subscribers, or segment leads based on engagement.

5. Choose whether or not to allow it to **retrigger** (i.e., should contacts re-enter the same automation in the future?)

6. Click **Create & Build** to open the Automation Builder

- **Connect** blocks by dragging arrows from one to the next

2. Choose a **List** or **Segment** that the automation should apply to

- Only contacts entering that list or segment will activate this automation

Filters allow you to run logic based on conditions like contact info or behavior.

Contact Info (e.g., email, tag, list)
Engagement (e.g., Last Opened)

You can chain filters together to create compound logic.

Events let you trigger flows based on user behavior + delays.

3. Set the **wait time** before the action should trigger

You can define what actions AudienceSend should take once a filter or event is true.

Double-click to open the editor
Name the email, write content, click **OK**

Use this to monitor activity (e.g., “if opened within 2 days, do X”)

Automatically copy or move contacts to a new list at any stage

Drag in a **Split** step and set a percentage to divide traffic for A/B testing

Use this to POST data to external tools (e.g., CRMs, Slack)

Add or remove tags based on actions (e.g., “add `replied` tag if clicked”)

- Used for drip sequences, pause before follow-up, etc.

- The final step of any automation is **Remove Contact**

- This stops further action and exits the contact from the automation

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/7---sign-up-forms/5fuJj2psGdLeS24QEyUUKi

Sign-up forms (also called **Opt-In Forms**) are embedded forms or pop-ups you can use to collect new contacts directly into AudienceSend. These forms can be used for lead generation, newsletter subscriptions, webinar registrations, or gated content access.

A Sign-Up Form is a web-based form that collects user information such as:

- Optional custom fields (e.g., phone number, company, etc.)

Once submitted, the data is saved to your AudienceSend contact database and automatically added to a list you choose.

3. Choose from one of the **predefined form templates**

- Add **Input Fields** like first name, phone number, job title

- Drag in additional elements like headlines, checkboxes, or descriptions

- Click on any element to edit the text, style, font, and formatting

5. Once you've styled the form the way you want, click **Next**

You can choose what happens when someone submits the form:

2. **Show a Thank You Message** directly on the page

- **List Selection** – Choose which AudienceSend list the new contacts should be added to

**Single Opt-In**: The contact enters their info and is subscribed immediately
**Double Opt-In**: The contact must click a confirmation link sent to their email

> Important: Double Opt-In is often recommended for compliance and better engagement quality.

2. You’ll be given a **URL** and/or **embed code** to place the form on your website

You can also connect the form to autoresponders or automations after publishing.

2. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to any form to:

### Creating and Managing Email Templates
<a id="activateTM-creating-and-managing-email-templates"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/51---email-templates/5fuJj2psGd8n1atUnpe7wk

Email templates in AudienceSend allow you to save reusable layouts and designs, ensuring consistency in branding, tone, and formatting across all your campaigns.

Templates are especially useful if you're managing newsletters, sequences, or branded updates where the structure remains constant but the content changes.

1. From the main menu, click **Create**, then select **Email Template**

3. (Optional) Add a **Category** and assign a **Sender**

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/creating-syncs/4z72nzTBAeu1h5NB63xbCE

### 🔁 Syncs Overview – Understanding Data Syncs in AudienceSync

**Syncs** define how your data is **transferred and mapped** from its source to its destination within **AudienceSync**.

- A **destination** (where the data should be delivered).

AudienceSync supports **two sync types**, each serving different use cases:

- **What it does:** Replaces _all_ the data in the destination with the data from the source.

- **When to use it:** When you want to completely overwrite the destination with the latest version from your source.

- **What it does:** Syncs only the data that has **changed since the last sync**.

- **When to use it:** Ideal for keeping your destination up to date with **only new or updated records** without overwriting existing data.

In **AudienceSync**, **streams** refer to the **destination APIs or objects** you are syncing data to.

Each stream represents a different target object in the destination platform where specific data types are synced.

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/cursor-fields/4z72nzTBAcqqMd2WDFBcc4

### 🔁 Incremental Syncs with Cursor Field – Minimizing Data Transfer in AudienceSync

AudienceSync supports an optimized **Incremental Sync** mode using a **Cursor Field**. This allows you to transfer **only new or updated records** by leveraging a field that tracks changes over time—resulting in **faster syncs** and **less data duplication**.

> 🔍 This feature is only available for sources that support cursor fields (currently only date fields are supported).

A **Cursor Field** acts as a **timestamp marker** to track what data has changed since the last sync.

- Ensures only **modified or added records** are synced.

- Enables the system to **resume exactly where it left off**.

- Optimizes performance and reduces API strain or data volume.

> ⚠️ Do not edit or remove a cursor field after setup—it may cause data loss or disrupt sync integrity.

```sql
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-20 10:00:00';
```

➡️ Both records are synced (all are considered new).

WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-21 10:00:00';
```

#### ⚖️ Handling Ambiguity & Inclusive Cursors

If the cursor field is too coarse (e.g., tracks **only dates**), distinguishing between **old and new records** within the same day may be difficult.

We implement **"at least once delivery"**—so even if there's ambiguity, data is **safely re-sent**. It avoids missing updates but may result in duplicates, which should be handled downstream.

- If a record changes **without updating the cursor field**, it **will not be picked up** in incremental syncs.

- **Editing or deleting** a cursor field **breaks the tracking system**, leading to **potential data loss or inconsistencies**.

> 🧷 To maintain sync reliability: Never change or remove the cursor field after configuration.

#### Code snippets

```sql
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-20 10:00:00';
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-20 11:00:00';

### Full Refresh Syncs – How They Work in AudienceSync
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-full-refresh-syncs-how-they-work-in-audiencesync"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/full-refresh-sync/4z72nzTBAeWCzhRWQZUMbX

### 🔁 Full Refresh Syncs – How They Work in AudienceSync

**Full Refresh** is a sync mode in **AudienceSync** used when you want to **completely replace existing data** in the destination with new data from the source.

This method retrieves **all available data**, regardless of what was previously synced, ensuring the destination always holds a **full, current snapshot** of the source.

- You want to **overwrite** all data in the destination.

- You need a **clean slate** with the latest source data.

- It’s okay to **lose old records** that are no longer present in the source.

- The system **deletes existing rows** in the destination table.

- It then inserts the **entire dataset** from the source.

Let’s say the destination contains a `Users` table:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | name | email |
| 1 | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 2 | Bob | bob@example.com |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | name | email |
| 1 | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 3 | Carol | carol@example.com |
| 4 | Dave | dave@example.com |

> 📝 Notice: Bob's record was removed, and new users Carol and Dave were added.

### Step 1: Prepare a Webhook Testing URL
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-step-1-prepare-a-webhook-testing-url"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/http-end-point-template/4z72nzTBAdZ9S7NAsWfqQP

**How to Set Up an HTTP Destination for a Webhook Test in AudienceSync**

This guide walks you through the exact steps to set up and test an HTTP destination using [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) with AudienceSync.

##### ✅ Step 1: Prepare a Webhook Testing URL

2. Copy the unique URL provided (e.g., `https://webhook.site/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)

3. This will be your temporary HTTP destination to catch and inspect POST requests.

##### ✅ Step 2: Create a New HTTP Destination in AudienceSync

1. Navigate to `Destinations → Add Destination → HTTP`

Click **"Add Header"**
For each header, map the **Key** and **Value**:

`Content-Type` → `application/json`
_(Optional)_`Authorization` → `Bearer test123token456`

> 🔐 You must explicitly map each header field in the destination setup screen. This ensures that the headers are included correctly in every outgoing request to the webhook or API endpoint.

In AudienceSync's destination setup screen, you'll see a section labeled **"Headers"**. Here, you must manually define each header by specifying a key-value pair. These headers are sent along with the HTTP request and are often required by APIs for proper request handling, authentication, or even routing.

##### 🔧 Examples of Header Mappings (Including User Data Fields)

Sometimes you'll see custom headers that begin with `x-`, like `x-user-name`. The `x-` prefix is a conventional way to indicate that a header is non-standard or proprietary — in other words, it's not part of the official HTTP specification like `Content-Type` or `Authorization`.

You **do not need** to use the `x-` prefix unless the destination API specifically requires it. It's just a naming convention. If you're sending metadata like a user's name, email, or phone number, and the receiving endpoint expects plain field names, you can name the headers without the `x-` prefix — such as `name`, `email`, or `phone_number`.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header Key | Header Value | Purpose |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Tells the server the format of the request body |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer your_token_here` | Required for Bearer token authentication |
| `name` | `John Doe` | Custom metadata: user's name passed in header |
| `email` | `john@example.com` | Custom metadata: user's email passed in header |
| `phone_number` | `+15551234567` | Custom metadata: user's phone number passed in header |
| `x-user-email` | `john@example.com` | Custom metadata: user's email passed in header |
| `x-user-phone` | `+15551234567` | Custom metadata: user's phone number passed in header |

> ⚠️ Note: AudienceSync may not support dynamic templating ({{ event.data.\* }}) inside headers. Use static values unless explicitly documented otherwise.

- Do **not** use quotes around keys or values unless the receiving API specifically requires them.

- If you're unsure what headers are needed, consult the documentation for the API you’re integrating with.

- Headers are key for authentication (e.g., Bearer tokens), content negotiation (`Accept`), or routing metadata (like user ID, email, etc.).

Correctly setting these headers is critical for successful integration, especially when dealing with platforms like HubSpot, Slack, or custom APIs expecting contextual user data. for successful integration, especially when dealing with platforms like HubSpot, Slack, or any service requiring authentication or specific content formats.. This ensures headers are correctly included in the request to the webhook or API endpoint.

- **Stream Name**: Select the name of the destination stream (e.g., `http`)

- **Sync Mode**: Choose `incremental` or `full_refresh`

- **Cursor Field**: Optional — use if syncing incrementally based on a timestamp

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Audience Field | HTTP Field |
| `EMAIL` | `email` |
| `FIRST_NAME` | `first_name` |
| `COMPANY` | `company` |

> These define the keys that will appear in your outgoing JSON payload.

```plain
{
  "email": "{{ event.data.email }}",
  "first_name": "{{ event.data.first_name }}",
  "company": "{{ event.data.company }}",
  "timestamp": "{{ event.timestamp }}"
}
```

You can adjust field names to match your column names from the audience query.

2. Go to the destination and click **"Test Destination"**.

3. Watch the Webhook.site page for the incoming request.

- Headers including `Content-Type` and `Authorization` if added

- Always use `snake_case` for outgoing HTTP field names

- Double-check that mapped fields in your sync match what you're using in the body template

- You must map headers explicitly in the destination setup for them to be sent

- For testing Bearer tokens, any dummy token is acceptable on Webhook.site

You're now ready to send real data or integrate with production APIs like HubSpot by adjusting the destination URL and body format.

This guide is designed as a flexible **template** for testing and integrating HTTP destinations in AudienceSync. If you're connecting to a real API:

- ✅ Replace the Webhook.site URL with the real API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts`)

- ✅ Adjust the headers (e.g., correct `Authorization` token, custom headers, etc.)

- ✅ Update the body template to match the required schema for that API

- ✅ Review the destination API documentation to ensure you send exactly what it expects

Every API has different expectations, so be sure to reference the relevant docs and adjust your setup accordingly.

{
  "email": "{{ event.data.email }}",
  "first_name": "{{ event.data.first_name }}",

```
prefix unless the destination API specifically requires it. It's just a naming convention. If you're sending metadata like a user's name, email, or phone number, and the receiving endpoint expects plain field names, you can name the headers without the
```
```
Bearer your_token_here
```

### 📥 HubSpot Destination Setup – Connecting HubSpot to AudienceSync

**HubSpot** is a unified customer platform combining marketing, sales, content, and customer service tools. You can connect HubSpot to **AudienceSync** by creating a **private app** that provides a secure **access token** to sync your data.

- You have **superuser admin access** to create and authorize private apps.

> 🔐 HubSpot private apps enable secure API access with fine-grained permissions.

##### 1\. **Locate the Private Apps Section**

- **Description:** Briefly describe your app’s purpose

- Use the **search bar** to find specific data types

- Select **"Write"** access for the necessary scopes (e.g., Contacts, Companies, Deals)

- After creation, HubSpot will show your **access token**

- Paste the **access token** into the **AudienceSync destination configuration** for HubSpot

- This token enables the secure syncing of data to your HubSpot account

- Treat your access token like a password— **keep it private**

- You can regenerate tokens from the private app settings if needed

### Incremental Syncs – Syncing Only New or Updated Data in AudienceSync
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-incremental-syncs-syncing-only-new-or-updated-data-in-audiences"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/incremental-syncs/4z72nzTBAdFxWi5Vxh8sAG

### 🔁 Incremental Syncs – Syncing Only New or Updated Data in AudienceSync

**Incremental syncs** transfer only the data that has **changed since the last sync**—this includes **new or updated records**, minimizing data transfer and reducing redundancy.

This method avoids resending previously synced data by using a **unique primary key** and a reliable update-tracking field (like `updated_at`).

> 📝 Note: The first incremental sync behaves like a full refresh because all data is considered new.

1. A **unique primary key** (set during model creation) is used to identify each row.

2. AudienceSync checks for changes using a column like `updated_at`, `modified`, or `timestamp`.

3. Only **new or modified rows** are included in each sync.

4. Destination data is **updated or appended** as needed.

### Model Overview – Creating Models in AudienceSync
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-model-overview-creating-models-in-audiencesync"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/intro-to-models/4z72nzTBAd52VGMVhAUZHv

### 📘 Model Overview – Creating Models in AudienceSync

Models in **AudienceSync** help you **define and organize data** from multiple sources, making it easier to build efficient, query-ready datasets.

This guide walks you through the **end-to-end model creation process**—from selecting a data source to defining your model using SQL, Table Selector, or dbt.

#### 🗂️ Understanding the Model Creation Workflow

The model-building process in AudienceSync is streamlined across six main steps:

#### ✅ Step 1: Navigate to the Models Section

- Choose a connected data warehouse from your list of integrations.

- This will serve as the foundation for your model.

- **SQL Query** – Write a custom query to define your model.

- **Table Selector** – Use a visual interface for building models.

- **dbt Model** – Reference prebuilt dbt models for advanced transformation.

- Click **Run Query** to preview results and confirm the structure.

- Provide a **descriptive name** and **brief description** for clarity and future reference.

- A unique key ensures **each record** can be uniquely identified.

- It's critical for **accurate data synchronization**—tracking only **new or updated rows**.

- During model setup, select a column with **unique values**.

- If no such column exists, consider creating a **composite key** or transforming the data to ensure uniqueness.

Once complete, your model is ready for activation within **AudienceSync**!

### 🏁 Salesforce Destination Setup – Connecting Salesforce to AudienceSync

This guide walks you through setting up **Salesforce** as a destination in **AudienceSync**. You’ll learn how to configure a **Connected App**, obtain OAuth credentials, and generate access and refresh tokens for secure syncing.

Before starting, ensure you’re using one of the following Salesforce editions:

- **Professional Edition** (with API access add-on)

> 🔐 These editions support the required API access for syncing.

- In the **API section**, check **"Enable OAuth Settings"**.

`Access and manage your data (api)`
`Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`
`Provide access to your data via the Web (web)`

##### Step 1: **Get the Authorization Code**

- Open this URL in your browser (replace placeholders):

```plain
plaintext
https://INSTANCE_URL.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CONSUMER_KEY&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com/
```

- The URL will redirect and contain a `?code=...` parameter.

##### Step 2: **Exchange the Code for Tokens**

Run the following `curl` command (replace placeholders):

```shell
curl -X POST "https://INSTANCE_URL.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token?code=CODE&grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=CONSUMER_KEY&client_secret=CONSUMER_SECRET&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com/"
```

```json
json
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token",
  "instance_url": "https://your-instance.salesforce.com",
  ...
}
```

Store these credentials securely. You will use them to connect AudienceSync to Salesforce.

### Data Normalization Templates (AudienceSync)
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-data-normalization-templates-audiencesync"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencesync-cdp/4z72nzTBAcUz3cT3wdduZB/sql-templates-/4zZX2JnYtLBEh9KemnnDZM

### 🧠 Data Normalization Templates (AudienceSync)

This guide walks you through two templates for exploding comma-separated fields inside **AudienceSync**. Both templates help you normalize messy audience data for upload to platforms like Facebook Ads, TikTok, or CRMs.

58 sec⚡️1 min 13 sec58 sec48 sec39 sec34 sec29 sec23 sec

Note: Make sure to leave no unnecessary spaces when pasting in the queries.

#### 📦 Template 1: **Explode Values Template**

You have a **single column** with **comma-separated values** (e.g., `hash1,hash2,hash3`) and want to **split it into multiple rows**, one value per row.

- Uses `STRING_SPLIT(..., ',')` to break values into an array.

- Uses `TRIM(...)` and `WHERE` filters to clean empty/blank values.

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  TRIM(value) AS sha256_personal_email
FROM (
  SELECT
    UNNEST(STRING_SPLIT(SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL, ',')) AS value
  FROM all_sources
)
WHERE value IS NOT NULL
  AND value <> '';
```

> 🔁 Replace SHA256\_PERSONAL\_EMAIL with your column name

You have multiple fields (e.g., `SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL`, `MOBILE_PHONE`, etc.) containing **comma-separated values**, and you need:

- Static fields (like `FIRST_NAME`) repeated for each row

- Uses `COALESCE(...)` to select the first non-empty email or phone

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SHA256\_PERSONAL\_EMAIL | SHA256\_BUSINESS\_EMAIL | MOBILE\_PHONE | FIRST\_NAME |
| hash1,hash2 | hash3 | 1111,2222,3333 | Alice |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| normal\_email | normal\_phone | FIRST\_NAME |
| hash1 | 1111 | Alice |
| hash2 | 2222 | Alice |
| hash3 | 3333 | Alice |

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  -- Combined Email Field
  COALESCE(
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_sha256[idx]), ''),
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_sha256_business_email[idx]), '')
  ) AS normal_email,

-- Combined Phone Field
  COALESCE(
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_mobile_phone[idx]), ''),
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_personal_phone[idx]), ''),
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_direct_number[idx]), '')
  ) AS normal_phone,

-- Static fields (not exploded)
  FIRST_NAME,
  LAST_NAME,
  PERSONAL_CITY,
  PERSONAL_STATE,
  PERSONAL_ZIP,
  GENDER
FROM (
  SELECT
    -- Splitting multi-value fields
    split(SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL, ',') AS split_sha256,
    split(PERSONAL_EMAILS, ',') AS split_emails,
    split(DIRECT_NUMBER, ',') AS split_direct_number,
    split(MOBILE_PHONE, ',') AS split_mobile_phone,
    split(PERSONAL_PHONE, ',') AS split_personal_phone,
    split(SHA256_BUSINESS_EMAIL, ',') AS split_sha256_business_email,

-- Static fields passed through
    FIRST_NAME,
    LAST_NAME,
    PERSONAL_CITY,
    PERSONAL_STATE,
    PERSONAL_ZIP,
    GENDER,

-- Index list for row explosion
    range(
      0,
      GREATEST(
        array_length(split(SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL, ',')),
        array_length(split(PERSONAL_EMAILS, ',')),
        array_length(split(DIRECT_NUMBER, ',')),
        array_length(split(MOBILE_PHONE, ',')),
        array_length(split(PERSONAL_PHONE, ',')),
        array_length(split(SHA256_BUSINESS_EMAIL, ','))
      )
    ) AS idx_list
  FROM all_sources
) t,
UNNEST(idx_list) AS idx_struct(idx)
WHERE (
  (split_sha256[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_sha256[idx] <> '')
  OR (split_sha256_business_email[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_sha256_business_email[idx] <> '')
)
AND (
  (split_mobile_phone[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_mobile_phone[idx] <> '')
  OR (split_personal_phone[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_personal_phone[idx] <> '')
  OR (split_direct_number[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_direct_number[idx] <> '')
);
```

- Combines **SHA256\_PERSONAL\_EMAIL** and **SHA256\_BUSINESS\_EMAIL** into a single column called `normal_email`

- Merges **MOBILE\_PHONE**, **PERSONAL\_PHONE**, and **DIRECT\_NUMBER** into a single `normal_phone`

- Retains static fields like `FIRST_NAME`, `ZIP`, and `GENDER`

- Ensures one clean value per row — exactly what Facebook, TikTok, and Google expect

### 🧠 Template 3: **State and Field Selection Template (AudienceSync)**

This template shows you how to **select specific fields** based on **geography or attribute filters**, like `PERSONAL_STATE = 'NY'`.

It’s designed for simple but powerful selections inside **AudienceSync**.

#### 📦 Template 3: **State and Field Selection**

You need to pull a specific subset of records based on a **filter condition** like "State = NY", "State = CA", or any other field match.

- Pick the fields you want to SELECT (e.g., emails, names, phones).

- Use a simple `WHERE` clause to filter by state, gender, or any attribute.

- AudienceSync will return only matching rows — clean and ready for export or processing.

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  FIELD1,
  FIELD2,
  FIELD3
FROM all_sources
WHERE FILTER_COLUMN = 'your_filter_value';
```

> 🔁 Replace FIELD1, FIELD2, FILTER\_COLUMN, and 'your\_filter\_value'

### 📚 Example 1: Select Emails and Names Where State is NY

Pull `PERSONAL_EMAILS`, `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME` only for users in **New York**.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PERSONAL\_EMAILS | FIRST\_NAME | LAST\_NAME | PERSONAL\_STATE |
| alice@example.com | Alice | Johnson | NY |
| bob@example.com | Bob | Smith | CA |
| dave@example.com | Dave | Wilson | NY |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PERSONAL\_EMAILS | FIRST\_NAME | LAST\_NAME |
| alice@example.com | Alice | Johnson |
| dave@example.com | Dave | Wilson |

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  PERSONAL_EMAILS,
  FIRST_NAME,
  LAST_NAME
FROM all_sources
WHERE PERSONAL_STATE = 'NY';
```

### 📚 Example 2: Select Mobile Phones Where State is CA

Pull `MOBILE_PHONE` and `FIRST_NAME` only for users in **California**.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MOBILE\_PHONE | FIRST\_NAME | PERSONAL\_STATE |
| 1234567890 | Alice | CA |
| 0987654321 | Bob | NY |
| 5551234567 | Carol | CA |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| MOBILE\_PHONE | FIRST\_NAME |
| 1234567890 | Alice |
| 5551234567 | Carol |

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  MOBILE_PHONE,
  FIRST_NAME
FROM all_sources
WHERE PERSONAL_STATE = 'CA';
```

- Quickly segment users by state for regional marketing pushes.

### 📦 Template 4: **First Email from Raw Text** (AudienceSync)

Extract the **first email address** from a messy, comma-separated list in the `PERSONAL_EMAILS` field — even when formatting is inconsistent (spaces, no quotes, weird separators, etc.).

This version is fast, reliable, and does **not require splitting arrays** or cleaning input manually.

- `PERSONAL_EMAILS` contains multiple emails in one string

- Formatting is inconsistent (e.g., `email1, email2`, or `"email1" , email2`)

```plain
srmatthews1967@gmail.com, marhodes34@gmail.com, sharon.matthews@att.net
```

```plain
   first@example.com , second@example.com  , third@example.com
```

#### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  FIRST_NAME,
  LAST_NAME,
  PERSONAL_ADDRESS,
  PERSONAL_CITY,
  PERSONAL_STATE,
  PERSONAL_ZIP,

-- Extract the first valid email pattern
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(PERSONAL_EMAILS, '[^, ]+@[^, ]+') AS first_personal_email,

SKIPTRACE_WIRELESS_NUMBERS,
  SKIPTRACE_DNC
FROM all_sources
WHERE SKIPTRACE_WIRELESS_NUMBERS IS NOT NULL
  AND SKIPTRACE_WIRELESS_NUMBERS <> ''
  AND PERSONAL_EMAILS IS NOT NULL
  AND PERSONAL_EMAILS <> '';
```

- `REGEXP_EXTRACT(..., '[^, ]+@[^, ]+')` finds the first **valid-looking email** — skipping spaces and commas

- Works **even if**`PERSONAL_EMAILS` is sloppy, inconsistent, or has mixed delimiters

- 🔄 Want to get the **second** email instead? Use `regexp_extract_all(...)[1]`

- 🧼 Want to force lowercase? Wrap with `LOWER(...)`

- 💡 Want to use this on another field? Just swap `PERSONAL_EMAILS` with any column

### SQL Editor Guide – Defining Models with AudienceSync
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-sql-editor-guide-defining-models-with-audiencesync"></a>

### 📘 SQL Editor Guide – Defining Models with AudienceSync

The SQL Editor in **AudienceSync** lets you **define and manage data models** using native SQL queries compatible with your data warehouse. This offers a flexible, powerful way to shape data for activation and analysis.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data.customers
```

- Click **Preview** to load the **first 100 rows**.

> ⚠️ Note: You cannot save the model if the query is invalid or returns no data.

Every model **must** have a **unique primary key**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer_data
GROUP BY unique_identifier_column
```

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       email,
       purchase_date,
       MD5(CONCAT(customer_id, '-', email)) AS composite_key
FROM sales_data
```

If your model currently has no data but will in the future, use:

```sql
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_dataset
WHERE important_column1 IS NOT NULL AND important_column2 IS NOT NULL
```

Replace `important_column1`, `important_column2`, etc., with your actual field names.

#### Code snippets

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data.customers
```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer_data
GROUP BY unique_identifier_column
```
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       email,
       purchase_date,
       MD5(CONCAT(customer_id, '-', email)) AS composite_key
FROM sales_data
```
```sql
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_dataset
WHERE important_column1 IS NOT NULL AND important_column2 IS NOT NULL
```

## FAQ

### Frequently Asked Questions For AudienceSync CDP
<a id="faq-frequently-asked-questions-for-audiencesync-cdp"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/faq/4NYS4Rtcnb5ie5ogTHmETZ/audiencesync-cdp/4NYS4RtcncEvnba18Qp8P7

#### ❓ Why is my sync stuck in progress or syncing very slowly?

This typically happens when your query runs too frequently, such as every few minutes, which can **overload the system**.

👉 **Recommendation:** Set your queries to run **every 1–3 days**. Since the data refreshes only once per day, running the query more frequently offers no additional benefit and may slow down processing for other syncs.

This occurs when the **primary key** used in your model is **not included in your sync configuration**.

✅ Make sure the **primary key** (e.g., `user_id`, `email`) is present both in your model and in the sync settings. This ensures the system can properly identify and track each record, preventing unnecessary skips.

#### ❓ Why does the sync show 0 rows processed even though it’s active?

This often means you’re using a **cursor field that doesn’t exist** in your data source.

📌 For example, if your sync is configured to track changes using a field like `updated_at`, but that field is missing or empty, no records will be found or processed.

➡️ **Solution:** Double-check that the cursor field:

- Is consistently populated with valid values (e.g., timestamps)

#### ❓ Why isn't my Facebook destination syncing properly?

This is typically caused by using the **wrong Audience ID**.

✅ **Do use** the **Audience ID from your Facebook Ad Account** (found in Ads Manager).

- ✅ Correct: `23842999999930541` (from Facebook Ads Manager)

- ❌ Incorrect: `aud_32903_audience_lab_sync` (from AudienceLab platform)

#### ❓ Why can’t I map fields when syncing to Google Sheets?

This happens when the Google Sheet is missing essential structure.

- Make sure the first row contains **headers** (e.g., `email`, `name`, `timestamp`)

- Include at least **one row of sample data** below the headers

🛠 Without this structure, the system cannot detect or display the available fields for mapping.

#### ❓ Why are only 1,000–10,000 rows syncing while thousands are skipped?

The sync only sends **net new records** each time it runs.

➡️ The sync will process and send only those 1,500 new records

🧠 **Tip:** If you want to resend all records (including old ones):

#### Code snippets

```
aud_32903_audience_lab_sync

### Step-by-Step Guide: Extract the First Value from Any Comma-Separated Field in Make.com
<a id="audiencelab-v3-step-by-step-guide-extract-the-first-value-from-any-comma-separat"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencelab-v3/4KR8gkKWfJNWx7Xncc7dwK/extracting-first-values-makecom/4Mc1KyutA5i2sHvsBQ2HoX

4 min⚡️4 min 36 sec3 min 41 sec3 min 4 sec2 min 27 sec2 min 10 sec1 min 50 sec1 min 28 sec

This guide shows you how to extract **only the first value** from any field that contains multiple comma-separated entries (like emails, phone numbers, tags, etc.) using **Make.com**. This is perfect for sending just the primary value to tools like **Instantly**, **Google Sheets**, **Airtable**, or **Slack**.

```plain
BUSINESS_EMAIL = "john@example.com, support@brand.com, info@brand.com"
→ Extracted: john@example.com
```

```plain
MOBILE = "1234567890, 9876543210"
→ Extracted: 1234567890
```

```plain
TAGS = "sales, marketing, enterprise"
→ Extracted: sales
```

##### STEP 1: Webhook (or Any Input Source)

Make sure the field (like `BUSINESS_EMAIL` or `MOBILE`) contains values **separated by commas**.

##### STEP 2: Add an Iterator (if your data is bundled)

If your webhook sends data in an array (e.g. `result[]`):

##### STEP 3: Set Variable – Extract the First Value

Create a variable for each field where you want only the first value:

```plain
Variable Name: FirstEmail
Value: {{trim(get(split(2.BUSINESS_EMAIL; ","); 1))}}
```

```plain
Variable Name: FirstMobile
Value: {{trim(get(split(2.MOBILE; ","); 1))}}
```

```plain
Variable Name: FirstTag
Value: {{trim(get(split(2.TAGS; ","); 1))}}
```

_Update the_`2.` _reference depending on your scenario (it refers to the previous module number)._

- **Google Sheets** → Email column: `{{3.FirstEmail}}`

- You can safely apply this pattern to **any text field**

- Works even without an Iterator if you're processing one record at a time

Copy-paste this into any `Set Variable` value field:

```plain
{{trim(get(split(YOUR_FIELD; ","); 1))}}
```

This method gives you a clean, consistent way to always pull just the **first value** from any multi-entry string. It’s reusable across:

Set it once, and confidently send only the data you actually want to downstream tools.

### Event Metadata (Nested in `event_data`)
<a id="superpixel-event-metadata-nested-in-event_data"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/superpixel/3R2xsGUFPBQpxgzaZJNRP4/v3-superpixel-documentation/53RGL83M96NcAsznwPW46W

SuperPixel v3 is our latest identity and event tracking pixel built for performance marketers, data platforms, and analytics teams who need reliable, deterministic user data. It emphasizes **authenticated resolution**, **spam-resilient event tracking**, and seamless support for session and profile stitching—all with minimal configuration and maximum control.

- **Deterministic identity resolution chain** (Cookie → HEM → Universal ID → Profile)

- **Real-time validation** with no backend post-processing

SuperPixel v3 resolves users into persistent, portable profiles using a **multi-layered deterministic system**. Here’s how we do it:

Resolution starts with a `cookie_id` or `maid_id`. The user must authenticate for us to hash their email (HEM = Hashed Email).

- Captured email must match session IP & user agent

```json
json
{
  "cookie_id": "a1f2c3d4e5",
  "event": "authentication",
  "email_raw": "user@example.com",
  "hem": "4d186321c1a7f0f354b297e8914ab240",
  "ip": "192.168.0.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0"
}
```

> We never use IP-to-HEM guessing. IPs are used only for validation.

Each HEM is deterministically linked to a `uid`. If a user logs in across multiple browsers or devices, we group them under one `uid` when **2 or more identifiers match**:

```json
json
{
  "uid": "u_01HEABCX789TZY",
  "hem": "4d186321c1a7f0f354b297e8914ab240",
  "cookie_ids": ["a1f2c3d4e5", "b9g7k2m3t1"],
  "maids": ["aabbccddeeffgghh"]
}
```

`uid` is mapped to a `profile_id` where all behavioral and identity signals are consolidated:

```json
json
{
  "profile_id": "p_01HJXYZ12345",
  "uid": "u_01HEABCX789TZY",
  "hems": [\
    "4d186321c1a7f0f354b297e8914ab240",\
    "9b74c9897bac770ffc029102a200c5de"\
  ],
  "traits": {
    "last_seen_ip": "192.168.0.1",
    "device_type": "desktop",
    "geohash": "9q9hwgk7"
  },
  "event_count": 244
}
```

> Profiles are deduplicated automatically and never built from anonymous or inferred data.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Event Type | Description |
| `copy` | Fired when user copies text or content. |
| `page_view` | Triggered on full page load. |
| `exit_intent` | Fires when mouse moves toward top edge (likely tab close). |
| `deep_scroll` | Activated when user scrolls 75%+ of the page. |
| `idle_user` | Fires after a set period of inactivity (default: 60s). |
| `video_engagement` | Tracks video events like play, pause, complete. |
| `all_clicks` | Tracks all clicks across the page. |
| `file_downloads` | Tracks downloads of PDF, DOC, ZIP files, etc. |
| `all_form_submissions` | Tracks all form submission events. |

A fully enriched SuperPixel event may include multiple layers of information:

```json
json
{
  "pixel_id": "003daacb-d261-421c-9781-311df9c381d8",
  "hem_sha256": "1458ee23320e30d920f099f57b11000b89ab82a7456bf39dd663d9d0858fd88d",
  "event_timestamp": "2025-05-29T23:52:53Z",
  "ip_address": "35.191.85.117",
  "activity_start_date": "2025-05-29T23:52:53Z",
  "activity_end_date": "2025-05-29T23:53:53Z"
}
```

##### 📄 Event Metadata (Nested in `event_data`)

**Note**: `event_data` is nested and includes interactive element metadata.

##### 🧬 Resolution Metadata (Nested in `resolution`)

- Personal details: `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME`, `GENDER`, `AGE`, `INCOME_RANGE`

- Contact: `PERSONAL_EMAILS`, `PERSONAL_PHONE`, `MOBILE_PHONE_DNC`

- Address: `PERSONAL_ADDRESS`, `PERSONAL_CITY`, `STATE`, `ZIP`

- Enrichment: `NET_WORTH`, `HOMEOWNER`, `MARRIED`, `CHILDREN`, `SKIPTRACE_MATCH_SCORE`

> These fields are only populated when deterministic resolution is successful.

Control which events are captured directly in your SuperPixel init script:

```plain
js
SuperPixel.init({
  trackEvents: {
    copy: true,
    page_view: true,
    exit_intent: true,
    deep_scroll: false,
    idle_user: true,
    video_engagement: true,
    all_clicks: false,
    file_downloads: true,
    all_form_submissions: true
  }
});
```

> ⚠️ Disable high-volume events like all\_clicks if you're optimizing for efficiency.

- SuperPixel does **not use IP-to-HEM resolution**.

- When HEM is unavailable, fallback uses `IP → Company` enrichment with a cleaned IP table:

Filters out TOR nodes, proxies, datacenters
Known bot clouds are dropped by default

- No post-processing or retroactive enrichment is performed.

- All associations are made in-session using **observed**, **authenticated** events only.

- Shared device activity is tagged, and multiple HEMs can exist per browser session with clear timestamp tracking.

### How to Eliminate Noise To Get What You Want
<a id="custom-models-how-to-eliminate-noise-to-get-what-you-want"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/custom-models-/4z72nzTBAcQ8nqMRzSvb33/how-to-eliminate-noise-to-get-what-you-want/4z72nzTBAewfeeA3XzU45g

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but not perfect. They operate across hundreds of billions of URLs and documents, drawing meaning based on statistical context. This means:

> Even slight topic drift introduces massive noise.

If your topic description includes multiple entities, vague terms, or cross-cutting comparisons, you risk training the model on irrelevant or low-signal content.

- **One topic** (e.g., a brand, feature, or outcome)

- **One lens** (e.g., Brand, Function, Service, etc.)

- **One clear paragraph** (no keywords, comparisons, or fluff)

> Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive all offer CRM solutions to help businesses manage their sales pipelines...

- Triggers pages like G2, Capterra, Reddit comparisons

- Creates ambiguity around which product the model should anchor to

> Pipedrive is a sales CRM platform built to help small and mid-sized sales teams track deals, automate workflows, and visualize pipeline stages in real time. The platform includes features like customizable pipelines, deal rotting alerts, workflow automation, and email tracking. Sales managers use Pipedrive to gain visibility into rep activity and forecast revenue, while reps rely on its intuitive interface to manage daily tasks and move deals forward. It integrates with hundreds of tools including Google Workspace, Slack, and Zoom, and is especially popular among B2B startups and agencies looking for a lightweight, scalable CRM.

Outcome: This helps the model learn what Pipedrive _is_, _who it's for_, and _how it's used_.

##### 🤖 Hormozi Example: Going Deep with a Brand Lens

**Better Input**: "Alex Hormozi" with the **Brand Lens**

> Alex Hormozi is an entrepreneur, investor, and business educator best known for founding Acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies generating over $100M in annual revenue. He is the author of $100M Offers and $100M Leads, two bestselling books focused on offer creation and lead generation strategies for entrepreneurs.

He invests in companies that fit his acquisition criteria and mentors founders through content-rich resources under the Acquisition.com brand.

- Trains the model to distinguish _who_ he is _and what he does_

- Surfaces high-value content tied to **intent**, not popularity

#### 💰 The Power (and Value) of Custom Models

Custom models are one of the most powerful and monetizable tools inside AudienceLab. They’re not just about better targeting — they’re about building **high-value data assets** that can be sold, reused, and activated across any channel.

Unlike static segments or pre-built lists, custom models let you define **exactly who you want to reach based on behavior** — not demographics, not job titles, and not guesswork.

When used correctly, they become incredibly valuable:

- 🔍 **Target real-time intent** — people actively researching, comparing, or ready to buy

- ⚡ **Eliminate noise** — outperform broad audiences in outbound, email, and paid media

- 💼 **Sell them as premium data** — agencies and clients will pay for niche, high-performing audiences

- 🔁 **Activate on any platform** — Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, CRMs, or direct export

AudienceLab scans over **200 billion URLs per week**. That’s a lot of behavioral signals — but only if you feed the system with a clean, specific description. This is where most models fall short, and where you gain the advantage.

#### 🔑 The 3 Core Elements of a Great Custom Model

Start by defining **one clear behavior** someone is doing — not who they are.

- “Doctors looking for CRM tools” ← ICP included (filter later)

- “Marketing tools like HubSpot and ActiveCampaign” ← brand stacking

- “SaaS founders who need lead generation” ← too broad and persona-based

> ✅ Tip: AudienceLab is behavior-first. If you describe what someone is doing, the system will find them. You can always filter who they are later.

A **lens** frames how the system interprets the topic. Use only one per model.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Lens | Use When... |
| **Brand** | You want to target behavior around one brand |
| **Product** | You’re focused on a specific feature or offer |
| **Function** | You want to model what the solution _does_ |
| **Service** | You're modeling a consultation or delivery format |
| **Solution** | You’re modeling the problem being solved |
| **Event** | The behavior is tied to a trigger or trend |

Granularity = how **deep** or **narrow** the behavior should be.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Level | Example Behavior |
| 1 | “CRM software” (broad category) |
| 3 | “Cold email inbox warm-up tools” |
| 5 | “Automated sender rotation for domain health” |

> 💡 Think about what someone is doing right before they make a buying decision. That’s your Level 5.

- “Medical practices interested in hydrogen therapy”

Custom models are built on **what** people are doing, not **who** they are. After your model is live, you can apply filters by:

Let the model do its job. Keep the description clean.

Now that you understand the structure, you're ready to use the AI bot — trained on our system — to generate your paragraph for you.

### Understanding "Lenses" for Machine Learning Categorization
<a id="custom-models-understanding-lenses-for-machine-learning-categorization"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/custom-models-/4z72nzTBAcQ8nqMRzSvb33/understanding-lenses-/4z72nzTBAcCgR5kCsmx8Pg

Lenses are structured semantic perspectives that help categorize a topic based on _how the user or customer sees it_ when they land on a webpage, search for a solution, or consume content.

LLMs aren’t just decoding topics — they’re interpreting **user intent**. So we need to match descriptions to the **perspective a user has** when they arrive at a certain page.

- A user searching for "Apollo.io" is likely trying to learn what the company does (Brand lens)

- A user searching for "cold email deliverability" is trying to solve a problem (Solution lens)

- A user searching for "InboxRamp" is researching a product (Product lens)

By writing with the correct lens, we help the model:

- Avoid noise from comparison pages, forums, or irrelevant media mentions

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lens** | **Focus** | **Cold Email Software** | **Sales & Marketing CRM** | **Conversational AI Tools** |
| **Brand** | Company or named entity | Instantly.ai | Salesforce | Drift |
| **Product** | Specific product or feature | Smart Inbox | HubSpot Sales Starter | Intercom Inbox |
| **Solution** | The outcome the user wants | Cold email deliverability | Revenue pipeline visibility | 24/7 automated support |
| **Function** | What the tool actually does | Domain warm-up rotation | Lead scoring & CAC payback tracking | Natural language intent detection |
| **Service** | How the solution is delivered | Email outreach as-a-service | CRM onboarding and consulting | Bot-building services |
| **Event** | Where users learn or connect | Cold Email Bootcamp | Dreamforce | Conversational AI Summit |

> ✅ Choose ONE lens per topic to minimize ambiguity and maximize precision in model behavior.

### >\> [Access the AI Bot By Clicking Here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6818963b605481918ae71f155b338b4a-audiencelab-models-builder) <<

The AudienceLab AI bot is your shortcut to building clean, high-performing custom model descriptions — fast.

- Write one-paragraph descriptions using our **Clarity5 framework**

- Remove confusion, brand stacking, or persona noise

Whether you're starting from scratch or refining a known idea, the AI bot ensures your models are sharp, structured, and submission-ready.

#### 🧭 How to Use the AI Bot to Build a Custom Model

##### ✅ Step 1: Ask the Bot for a Suggestion

If you’re not sure how to frame your idea, start by asking the bot for a **suggestion**.

> “Give me a suggestion for people looking to refinance their home. Use the Solution lens. Granularity 3.”

The bot will return 2–4 specific, lens-based topic ideas.

- Specify a **lens** (Brand, Product, Function, Service, Solution, or Event)

> “Would you like this to be more specific or less specific?”

Use this prompt to fine-tune the idea before writing the paragraph.

##### ✅ Step 2: Choose Your Favorite Suggested Topic

Pick the topic that best matches the exact behavior you want to model.

> “Give me a suggestion for cold email. Lens: Function. Level 4.”

Now you're ready to generate the model description.

##### ✅ Step 3: Ask the Bot to Write the Model Description

Once your topic is chosen, ask the bot to generate a clean paragraph using **Generation Mode**.

> “Write a custom model for: domain rotation for sender reputation. Use the Function lens. Granularity 5.”

The AI bot will return a one-paragraph description using the **Clarity5 framework**:

> “Automated domain rotation systems that protect sender reputation, maintain cold email deliverability, and reduce blacklist risk for outreach teams scaling across multiple inboxes.”

2. Go to **AudienceLab → Custom Models → Create New**

**Note:** AudienceLab scans over 200 billion URLs per week — but your model only works if your input is sharp. That one paragraph is the signal.

##### ✅ Step 5: Add Filters After the Model is Built

Once your model is approved, you can apply filters to refine who you're targeting.

**Important:** Never include these filters in the model paragraph itself. The model is about _what_ someone is doing — the filters decide _who_ they are.

> “Can you review this for clarity and remove any noise?”

1. Ask the bot for a **suggestion** (intent + lens + granularity)

3. Ask the bot to **generate a one-paragraph description**

4. Paste into the **AudienceLab Custom Model Builder**

5. Apply ICP filters (job title, geo, domain) **after** model creation

> “Give me a suggestion for weight loss behavior. Function lens. Granularity 3.”

> “Write a model for zero-down HVAC financing. Service lens. Level 5.”

> “Review this model and remove any noise or broad terms.”

### 🧭 How to Build Your First Audience in Audience Lab

**Duration:** ~5 minutes \| **Feature:** Audience Lists \| **Difficulty:** Beginner

| Concept | Summary |
| **Audience Lists** | The main place where you’ll create and manage your target audiences from scratch. |
| **Strong Audiences** | Combine _who_ (business type) + _what_ (intent or service interest). |
| **AI Keyword Generator** | Finds companies based on services they offer using natural-language prompts. |
| **Job Title Filters** | Target decision-makers like _Founder, Co-Founder, Owner,_ or _President_. |
| **Intent Layering** | Add “intent” keywords to find users actively searching for a service (e.g., “lead generation”). |
| **Auto Refresh** | Schedule your audience to update daily, weekly, or bi-weekly for fresh data. |

#### 🧩 Step-by-Step: Building Your First Audience

##### **Step 1: Start Building Your Audience (0:27)**

🖱️ **Navigate:**`Left Menu → Audience Lists → Create Audience`

✏️ **Action:** Name your new audience (example: “TikTok Agencies – Lead Gen”).

Start by creating an audience you would _actually_ use — a practical case helps you learn faster.

**Example Goal:** Find _TikTok marketing agencies_ that are _actively looking for lead generation services_.

→ Combines a specific **business type (who)** with a clear **intent (what)**.

##### **Step 2: Define Your Target Market (1:23)**

1. Enter a descriptive phrase — e.g., **“agencies offering TikTok services” (1:47)**
2. Click **Generate → Continue → Preview**

A large, raw audience (often 500K+ records) — this is your _starting point_ before filtering.

##### **Step 3: Refine with Job Titles (2:43)**

Refining by titles typically reduces the list size but increases _relevance_.

In this example: from ~500K → ~60K high-quality contacts.

##### **Step 4: Layer on Intent Data (3:28)**

1. Use the **keyword search** for intent — enter **“lead generation services.”**
2. Click **Generate → Select “Medium” Intent Level (3:49)**

Your list now focuses on people actively looking for lead generation — making it hyper-relevant.

Start with “Medium” intent for balanced reach; “High” is narrower and for final-stage buyers.

##### **Step 5: Finalize and Schedule Your Audience (4:31)**

🖱️ Click **Generate Audience** → Wait for completion.

Set your **refresh schedule** to automatically update data:

Frequent refreshes (1–3 days) are best for fast-moving markets like agencies or SaaS.

| Filter Type | Example | Purpose |
| **Keyword Generator** | “agencies offering TikTok services” | Builds broad audience scope |
| **Job Titles** | Founder, Co-Founder | Focuses on decision-makers |
| **Intent Keywords** | “lead generation” | Finds active service-seekers |
| **Refresh Frequency** | 7 days | Keeps data fresh & relevant |

**Q:** Where do I start building a new audience? _(0:27)_

**A:** Go to **Audience Lists → Create Audience** on the dashboard.

**Q:** How do I find companies that offer a specific service? _(1:47)_

**A:** Use the **AI Keyword Generator** in the Business section — describe what they offer (e.g., “agencies offering TikTok services”).

**A:** It narrows your audience to key decision-makers like founders or owners.

**A:** Intent data identifies users currently researching a specific service or product online.

**Q:** What’s the difference between Low, Medium, and High intent? _(3:49)_

**A:** It measures purchase readiness — “High” = very close to buying; “Medium” = considering; “Low” = early research.

**Q:** How often should I refresh my audience? _(4:58)_

**A:** Choose 1–3 days for fast-changing verticals, or 7–14 days for stable industries.

Building your first audience in **Audience Lab** combines two main ideas:

- **Define who** you’re targeting (via business type + roles).
- **Identify what** they’re looking for (via intent keywords).

Once mastered, this workflow lets you generate dynamic, continuously refreshed lead lists — without repetitive manual work.

2. In Audience Lab, select your pixel and click **“Webhook.”**
3. Paste the webhook URL into the field.
4. Click **“Test”** to verify JSON events are arriving correctly.
5. Click **“Add”** to activate the webhook for continuous real-time updates.

> This allows automations, such as sending lead data to a CRM, without manual export.

| Question | Answer |
| **Where do I find the pixel on the Audience Lab dashboard? (0:00)** | Under **Integrations** in the main dashboard. |
| **Difference between viewing data in Studio vs. exporting? (0:43)** | Studio allows in-platform viewing and segmentation; exporting provides a raw file for offline use in spreadsheets or other apps. |
| **How do I install the pixel on my website? (2:36)** | Copy the script from the pixel dashboard and paste it into your website’s `<head>` HTML section. |
| **What is a webhook and why use it? (2:59)** | A webhook sends pixel data in real time to external platforms for automated workflows, like CRM integration. |
| **Can the pixel work with Google Analytics? (2:45)** | Yes, by adding your Google Analytics tracking ID, the pixel runs alongside existing analytics. |

### Use the Studio Persistent API Endpoint to Export Data
<a id="crisp-help-articles-use-the-studio-persistent-api-endpoint-to-export-data"></a>

**Source:** https://audiencelab.crisp.help/en/article/using-persistent-api-inside-studio-bnnqp3/

### 🚀 Use the Studio Persistent API Endpoint to Export Data

✅ Send your **Studio audience data** to apps like [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), **Zapier**, or **N8N**

✅ Use the **Persistent API URL** with your **Segment ID** \+ **API Key**

✅ Handle large data using **pagination (** **`page`** **,** **`page_size`** **)**

✅ Enable **auto-refresh** (e.g., every 3 days) for always-updated data

✅ Works with any tool that supports **HTTP requests**

How to Use the Studio Persistent API to Send Data to Make.com 🚀

The **Studio Persistent API** allows you to **export audience data directly** to external platforms such as CRMs, automation tools, and campaign systems — all without manual CSV exports.

You’ll learn how to connect **Studio →** [**Make.com**](https://make.com/) (and similar tools) using a simple HTTP request.

```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Persistent API| B[Make.com / Zapier]
B --> C[CRM / Campaign App]
```

Your Studio data flows continuously through the **Persistent API**, staying **fresh and synchronized** across systems.

#### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Data Segment in Studio

##### 🧭 Step 1.1 — Create and Refine Your Segment

1. Go to **Segments** in your Audience Lab account.
2. Choose an existing segment or click **➕ Create New Segment**.
3. Open the segment inside **Studio**.

🪄 **Tip:** Give your segment a clear, descriptive name (e.g., “Cold Campaign – Verified Emails”).

Click **“Build a New Table”** and add the desired columns:

| Field Type | Example Columns |
| 🔤 Identity | `First Name`, `Last Name` |
| 🏢 Company | `Company Name`, `Domain` |
| ✉️ Contact | `Business Verified Email` |
| 📱 Mobile | `Mobile` → use **Extract First Only** |

- `Business Verified Email is not empty`
- `Mobile is not empty`

- Click **Save Card** → name your table (e.g., “Cold Campaign”)
- Click **Load Segment** → confirm rows and columns look correct

#### 2️⃣ Configure the Persistent API Request in [Make.com](https://make.com/)

1. In [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), click **\+ Add Module** → select **HTTP**.
2. Choose **Make a Request**.

| 🔧 Setting | 📝 What to Enter | 💡 Example |
| **Method** | `GET` | — |
| **URL** | [`https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]`](https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]) | Replace `[STUDIOSEGMENTID]` |
| **Query Params** | `page=1`, `page_size=50` | Pulls first 50 records |
| **Header** | `X-API-Key: [YOUR_API_KEY]` | From Audience Lab → _Settings → API Keys_ |
| **Parse Response** | ✅ ON | Enables structured field mapping |

```
GET https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ABC123?page=1&page_size=50
X-API-Key: sk_live_1234567890abcdef
```

📎 This will return a **JSON response** of your segment’s contacts and fields.

1. Go to **Segments** in Audience Lab.
2. Copy the **Segment ID** under your saved segment name.
3. Paste it into your HTTP module’s URL.

Run once → You should now see structured data ready to map to your next module (HubSpot, Instantly, Gmail, etc.).

1. Go back to your **main audience dashboard**.
2. Click the ⚙️ **Settings icon** next to your segment.
3. Enable **Auto Refresh** and set interval → e.g. **Every 3 Days**.

This ensures your Persistent API endpoint always delivers fresh, verified data.

```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Auto Refresh Every 3 Days| B[Persistent API]
B -->|Feeds| C[Connected Apps / Workflows]
```

A: Because the API continuously provides updated data as your segment refreshes — not a one-time snapshot.

A: Yes. Any tool supporting HTTP GET requests works.

A: Exports are static; Persistent API delivers **live, continuously updated data**.

It ensures only the first (and most accurate) mobile number is exported.

Add a filter → **Business Verified Email is not empty.**

Yes — use different keys per integration for better management and security.

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
| 🔸 Data looks incomplete | Pagination limit | Add `page` \+ `page_size` params or loop |
| 🔸 Only raw JSON appears | Parse Response OFF | Turn **Parse Response ON** |
| 🔸 Fewer contacts than expected | Strict filters | Review Studio filters for exclusions |

In [Make.com](https://make.com/), use an iterator or repeater to fetch all pages sequentially.

Create one per connected platform (e.g., Zapier, HubSpot).

| 🎯 Goal | ⚙️ Setup |
| Sync verified leads to HubSpot daily | Persistent API → [Make.com](https://make.com/) → HubSpot Create Contact |
| Auto-update cold outreach lists | Persistent API → Zapier → Instantly |
| Build dynamic ad audiences | Persistent API → N8N → Google Sheets / Meta Ads |

#### Code snippets

```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Persistent API| B[Make.com / Zapier]
B --> C[CRM / Campaign App]
```
```
GET https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ABC123?page=1&page_size=50
X-API-Key: sk_live_1234567890abcdef
```
```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Auto Refresh Every 3 Days| B[Persistent API]
B -->|Feeds| C[Connected Apps / Workflows]
```
```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
```
Business Verified Email
```
```
Business Verified Email is not empty
```
```
https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]
```
```
X-API-Key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
```

<a id="crisp-help-articles-using-studio-to-segment-the-pixel-data"></a>

**Source:** https://audiencelab.crisp.help/en/article/using-studio-to-segment-the-pixel-data-bxzbz5/

**Duration:** ~2 minutes \| **Feature:** Studio & Pixel \| **Difficulty:** Beginner–Intermediate

- The **Studio Persistent API** lets you send your Studio data to apps like [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), **Zapier**, or any HTTP tool. (0:00)
- Create and save your desired segment in Studio, ensuring the table contains required fields (e.g., verified email, mobile). (0:43)
- In your no-code tool, use an HTTP module to call the Persistent API URL with your **Segment ID** in the path. (4:03)
- Include your **X-API-Key** header and use query params `page` \+ `page_size` for pagination. (4:18)
- Set your segment to auto-refresh (e.g., every 3 days) to continuously push fresh data. (8:45)

The **Studio Persistent API** exports refined audience data from Studio to external applications (CRMs, marketing automation tools, lead enrichment platforms). This guide shows how to set it up using [**Make.com**](https://make.com/) **(Integromat)**; the steps map closely to **Zapier** or **N8N**. (0:12)

#### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Data Segment in Studio

##### 1.1 Create and Refine Your Segment (0:27 – 0:36)

1. Navigate to **Segments** in your Audience Lab account. (0:27)

- `First name`, `Last name` (1:06)
- `Company domain`, `Company name` (1:06)
- `Business verified emails` (1:56)
- `Mobile` — use **Extract First Only** for highest accuracy (1:24)

- Filter so Business Verified Email is not empty and/or Mobile Phone is not empty to ensure a clean list. (2:12)

- Click **Save Card** and name the segment (e.g., “Cold Campaign”). (3:08)
- Load the segment to verify it saved correctly and that rows/columns are ready for export. (3:23 – 3:31)

✅ Your Studio segment is now ready for the Persistent API.

#### 2️⃣ Configure the Persistent API Request in [Make.com](https://make.com/)

- This ensures the Persistent API always returns fresh data for connected automations. (8:51)

**Q: What is the Studio Persistent API and why is it called “persistent”?**

A: The API returns a live feed of your Studio segment. Because the segment can auto-refresh (for example every 3 days), the endpoint persistently serves up-to-date data — not a single snapshot. (0:00 / 8:45)

**Q: Can I use the Persistent API with Zapier or N8N?**

A: Yes. Any tool that supports HTTP GET requests with custom headers will work. The setup steps (URL structure, header, pagination) are the same. (0:12 / 4:03)

A: Exports are one-off snapshots. The Persistent API provides a continuous data feed that updates as your segment refreshes. (4:56 / 8:45)

A: Only the fields you add to the Studio data table for that saved segment. Build and save the table before using the API. (0:43 / 1:06)

A: If contacts have multiple numbers, this option pulls only the first (typically highest-accuracy) mobile number. Recommended for phone-based outreach. (1:24)

**Q: How can I ensure the API only returns verified emails?**

A: Add a filter in Studio: `Business Verified Email is not empty` (2:12). The API exports only the rows currently present in the saved table. (2:12 / 3:08)

A: Under the saved segment name in **Segments**. Copy it and paste into the API URL. (5:57 – 6:09)

A: **Settings → API Keys** in Audience Lab. You can generate specific keys (e.g., “API Key Studio”). (5:14 / 5:36)

A: Yes — the standard secure pattern is `X-API-Key: your_key_here`. Use HTTPS for the request. (4:36 / 5:14)

A: Yes — generate separate keys per integration for better rotation and security. (5:36)

**Q: Why is my response raw JSON even with Parse Response enabled?**

A: Make sure **Parse response** is explicitly set to ON. If OFF, the module returns raw JSON text. (6:45)

**Q: API returns only a subset of data — what now?**

A: Check your Studio filters — strict filters may reduce rows. Also implement pagination: `page` \+ `page_size` and loop through pages in your automation tool. (2:45 / 4:56)

**Q: Can I dynamically change the Segment ID in the request?**

A: Yes — advanced workflows can pull a Segment ID from a spreadsheet or DB and use it in the HTTP module URL to process multiple segments. (6:34)

- **Pagination Loop:** For large segments, build a loop/iterator in Make/Zapier to fetch all pages until no results remain. (4:56)
- **API Key Management:** Use dedicated keys per tool (Zapier, Make, HubSpot). Rotate keys if exposure is suspected. (5:36)
- **Auto-Refresh + API:** Combine auto-refresh with your automation schedule to ensure campaigns always use fresh data (e.g., set segment refresh every 3 days and run automation after refresh). (8:45 – 8:51)

```
https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ID?page=1&page_size=50
```

- Module: HTTP → Make a request (4:03)
- Method: GET (4:26)
- URL: Paste template with Segment ID (4:56)
- Query params: `page=1`, `page_size=50` (4:56)
- Header: `X-API-Key` (5:14)
- Parse response: ON (6:45)
- Test: Run module once (6:49 – 7:04)

### Installing the SuperPixel and Syncing Data
<a id="crisp-help-articles-installing-the-superpixel-and-syncing-data"></a>

**Source:** https://audiencelab.crisp.help/en/article/installing-the-superpixel-and-syncing-data-1x0jdmy/

**Duration:** ~5 minutes \| **Feature:** Super Pixel \| **Difficulty:** Beginner–Intermediate

| Concept | Summary |
| **Purpose** | The Audience Lab Pixel tracks visitor behavior on your website. |
| **Management** | Access and manage the pixel in **Integrations**—view data, get the script, set up webhooks, or delete the pixel. |
| **Data Usage** | View and segment pixel data in Studio, or export raw data for a given period. |
| **Webhook** | Sends pixel data in real time to external tools like [Make.com](https://make.com/), Zapier, or custom applications. |
| **Installation** | Add the generated script to your website’s `<head>` section; can run alongside Google Analytics. |

#### 🔍 Understanding the Pixel Dashboard (0:00)

From the **Integrations** section, you can manage your Audience Lab Pixel and perform the following actions:

| Action | Description |
| **View Pixel Data** | Summary of all data collected by the pixel. |
| **View Script** | Access the HTML/JS code needed for installation. |
| **Webhook the Pixel** | Set up automatic real-time data transfer to external tools. |
| **View in Studio** | Analyze and segment pixel data inside Audience Lab. |
| **Export Data** | Download a raw file for a specific time period. |
| **Delete** | Remove the pixel from your account if it’s no longer needed. |

#### 📊 Viewing and Exporting Pixel Data (0:28)

1. Click on your pixel and select **“Resolution”** to view all collected data.
2. To work offline, **export the data**:

- Go back to the pixel dashboard.
- Select your pixel and click **“Export Data.”**
- Click **“Create Export”** and choose a time period (e.g., 30 days).

> ⚠️ Large files may be auto-deleted after 30–60 days. Use a webhook for real-time access instead.

1. Click **“Create”** and name your pixel.
2. Enter your website’s URL (include [`https://`](https://audiencelab.crisp.help/en/article/installing-the-superpixel-and-syncing-data-1x0jdmy/) and root domain, e.g., `https://example.com`).
3. Click **“Create”** to generate the script.
4. Paste the script into the `<head>` section of your website.
5. Optionally, integrate your **Google Analytics tracking ID** to run the pixel alongside your analytics.

Webhooks enable **real-time data transfer** from the pixel to external platforms:

1. Obtain a **webhook URL** from your chosen service (Make.com, Zapier, or custom).
2. In Audience Lab, select your pixel and click **“Webhook.”**
3. Paste the webhook URL into the field.
4. Click **“Test”** to verify JSON events are arriving correctly.
5. Click **“Add”** to activate the webhook for continuous real-time updates.

> This allows automations, such as sending lead data to a CRM, without manual export.

### Using Studio to Segment the Pixel Data
<a id="crisp-help-articles-using-studio-to-segment-the-pixel-data"></a>

**Source:** https://audiencelab.crisp.help/en/article/using-studio-to-segment-the-pixel-data-bxzbz5/

**Duration:** ~2 minutes \| **Feature:** Studio & Pixel \| **Difficulty:** Beginner–Intermediate

- The **Studio Persistent API** lets you send your Studio data to apps like [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), **Zapier**, or any HTTP tool. (0:00)
- Create and save your desired segment in Studio, ensuring the table contains required fields (e.g., verified email, mobile). (0:43)
- In your no-code tool, use an HTTP module to call the Persistent API URL with your **Segment ID** in the path. (4:03)
- Include your **X-API-Key** header and use query params `page` \+ `page_size` for pagination. (4:18)
- Set your segment to auto-refresh (e.g., every 3 days) to continuously push fresh data. (8:45)

The **Studio Persistent API** exports refined audience data from Studio to external applications (CRMs, marketing automation tools, lead enrichment platforms). This guide shows how to set it up using [**Make.com**](https://make.com/) **(Integromat)**; the steps map closely to **Zapier** or **N8N**. (0:12)

#### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Data Segment in Studio

##### 1.1 Create and Refine Your Segment (0:27 – 0:36)

1. Navigate to **Segments** in your Audience Lab account. (0:27)
2. Select an existing segment or create a new one. (0:34)
3. View the segment inside **Studio**. (0:36)

##### 1.2 Build Your Data Table (0:43 – 3:31)

- Click **Build a new table**. (0:43)
- Add data fields (columns), for example:

- `First name`, `Last name` (1:06)
- `Company domain`, `Company name` (1:06)
- `Business verified emails` (1:56)
- `Mobile` — use **Extract First Only** for highest accuracy (1:24)

- Filter so Business Verified Email is not empty and/or Mobile Phone is not empty to ensure a clean list. (2:12)

- Click **Save Card** and name the segment (e.g., “Cold Campaign”). (3:08)
- Load the segment to verify it saved correctly and that rows/columns are ready for export. (3:23 – 3:31)

✅ Your Studio segment is now ready for the Persistent API.

#### 2️⃣ Configure the Persistent API Request in [Make.com](https://make.com/)

##### 2.1 Set Up the HTTP Module (4:03 – 4:26)

1. In [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), add an **HTTP** module. (4:03)
2. Choose **Make a request** and set **Method** → `GET`. (4:26)

##### 2.2 Configure the Request Details (4:18 – 6:45)

```
  https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]
```

Replace `[STUDIOSEGMENTID]` after you copy it from Studio. (4:56)

```
  Key: X-API-Key
  Value: [AUDIENCELAB_API_KEY]
```

Get the key from **Settings → API Keys** in your Audience Lab account. (5:14)

- Turn **Parse response** ON so the tool maps JSON fields automatically. (6:45)

```
GET https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ABC123?page=1&page_size=50
X-API-Key: sk_live_1234567890abcdef
```

Run the module once to test and view the parsed JSON response. (6:49 – 7:04)

#### 2.3 Get Your Segment ID (5:57 – 6:25)

- In Audience Lab: go to **Segments**, locate your saved segment (e.g., “Cold Campaign”), and copy the **Segment ID** shown under the name. (5:57 – 6:09)
- Paste that ID into your [Make.com](https://make.com/) HTTP module URL, replacing `[STUDIOSEGMENTID]`. (6:25)

#### 2.4 Test & Map the Data (6:49 – 7:39)

- Run the HTTP module to pull data from Studio. (6:49)
- The parsed fields (first name, email, mobile, company) are available to map into subsequent modules (e.g., HubSpot, Gmail, Instantly). (7:04 – 7:39)

#### 3️⃣ Automate Data Refresh (8:36 – 8:51)

- In Audience Lab: go to the main view for your segment and click the **settings** icon. (8:36)
- Set **Auto-Refresh** schedule, e.g., every **3 days**. (8:45)
- This ensures the Persistent API always returns fresh data for connected automations. (8:51)

**Q: What is the Studio Persistent API and why is it called “persistent”?**

A: The API returns a live feed of your Studio segment. Because the segment can auto-refresh (for example every 3 days), the endpoint persistently serves up-to-date data — not a single snapshot. (0:00 / 8:45)

**Q: Can I use the Persistent API with Zapier or N8N?**

A: Yes. Any tool that supports HTTP GET requests with custom headers will work. The setup steps (URL structure, header, pagination) are the same. (0:12 / 4:03)

A: Exports are one-off snapshots. The Persistent API provides a continuous data feed that updates as your segment refreshes. (4:56 / 8:45)

A: Only the fields you add to the Studio data table for that saved segment. Build and save the table before using the API. (0:43 / 1:06)

A: If contacts have multiple numbers, this option pulls only the first (typically highest-accuracy) mobile number. Recommended for phone-based outreach. (1:24)

**Q: How can I ensure the API only returns verified emails?**

A: Add a filter in Studio: `Business Verified Email is not empty` (2:12). The API exports only the rows currently present in the saved table. (2:12 / 3:08)

A: Under the saved segment name in **Segments**. Copy it and paste into the API URL. (5:57 – 6:09)

A: **Settings → API Keys** in Audience Lab. You can generate specific keys (e.g., “API Key Studio”). (5:14 / 5:36)

A: Yes — the standard secure pattern is `X-API-Key: your_key_here`. Use HTTPS for the request. (4:36 / 5:14)

A: Yes — generate separate keys per integration for better rotation and security. (5:36)

**Q: Why is my response raw JSON even with Parse Response enabled?**

A: Make sure **Parse response** is explicitly set to ON. If OFF, the module returns raw JSON text. (6:45)

**Q: API returns only a subset of data — what now?**

A: Check your Studio filters — strict filters may reduce rows. Also implement pagination: `page` \+ `page_size` and loop through pages in your automation tool. (2:45 / 4:56)

**Q: Can I dynamically change the Segment ID in the request?**

A: Yes — advanced workflows can pull a Segment ID from a spreadsheet or DB and use it in the HTTP module URL to process multiple segments. (6:34)

- **Pagination Loop:** For large segments, build a loop/iterator in Make/Zapier to fetch all pages until no results remain. (4:56)
- **API Key Management:** Use dedicated keys per tool (Zapier, Make, HubSpot). Rotate keys if exposure is suspected. (5:36)
- **Auto-Refresh + API:** Combine auto-refresh with your automation schedule to ensure campaigns always use fresh data (e.g., set segment refresh every 3 days and run automation after refresh). (8:45 – 8:51)

```
https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ID?page=1&page_size=50
```

- Module: HTTP → Make a request (4:03)
- Method: GET (4:26)
- URL: Paste template with Segment ID (4:56)
- Query params: `page=1`, `page_size=50` (4:56)
- Header: `X-API-Key` (5:14)
- Parse response: ON (6:45)
- Test: Run module once (6:49 – 7:04)

## Activate (AudienceSend)
<a id="activate-audiencesend"></a>

### 5fuJj2psGh37VtS1ECNF1H

Without a verified domain, your emails are far more likely to land in spam — or be blocked entirely.

Even though AudienceSend is an ESP, you still need your own domain for these reasons:

- “From” Domain: It controls the visible sender email (e.g. sarah@yourcompany.com)

- Deliverability: DNS records like SPF and DKIM authorize AudienceSend to send on your behalf — required by inbox providers

- Trust: Gmail, Outlook, etc., use your domain’s reputation to determine inbox vs. spam

- Branding: Recipients trust yourname@yourbrand.com more than a generic shared domain

- Compliance: Gmail and Yahoo block non-authenticated traffic starting in 2024

```plain
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:audiencesend.com ~all

Type: TXT
Host: audiencesend._domainkey
Value: (DKIM key provided)

Type: CNAME
Host: bounce
Value: return.audiencesend.com
```

1. Go to your DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

4. Click Verify in AudienceSend — once complete, you’ll see a Verified status

### How to Add Suppression Lists in AudienceSend
<a id="activateTM-how-to-add-suppression-lists-in-audiencesend"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/2---load-your-list-/5fuJj2psGemmLPXu8sudvU

Before you can send any emails, you need to upload or sync your target contacts into AudienceSend. You can do this manually via CSV or automatically via webhook integration (e.g., Make.com or Zapier) \*coming soon.

8. You need to choose a segment or tag for this upload (e.g., “Cold List - July”)

After upload, you’ll see a confirmation screen and can view the contacts under `Contacts > View Contacts`.

A **suppression list** is a safety filter that tells AudienceSend **who not to email under any circumstance**, even if those contacts are accidentally added to a campaign.

- It's a list of email addresses or domains that are blocked from receiving messages

Messaging unsubscribed users
Re-emailing past customers
Accidentally reaching competitors or internal test accounts

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Benefit | Description |
| Compliance | Helps you follow GDPR, CAN-SPAM, TCPA, etc. |
| Brand Safety | Prevents messaging sensitive groups or competitors |
| List Quality | Ensures you're not wasting sends on disengaged or opted-out users |
| Performance | Avoids hurting deliverability by re-emailing bounced or spam-reported addresses |

3. Choose **Email Address** or **Domain-Level Suppression**

5. Save — AudienceSend will now automatically filter out these emails from **all future sends**, even if you try to import or trigger them into a campaign

- Suppress your own internal company domain to avoid test emails slipping through

- Suppress recent customers or low-fit segments to avoid overlap

#### Understanding Lists, Segments, and Tags

AudienceSend gives you three powerful tools to manage and organize your contacts: **Lists**, **Segments**, and **Tags**. Each plays a different role in how you group, filter, and target your audience.

A **List** is a static group of contacts you upload or sync into AudienceSend.

- Think of a list as a spreadsheet or file of people you’re uploading together

- Lists don’t change unless you manually add/remove contacts

- Great for cold uploads, ad exports, or lead magnet opt-ins

- Need to segment audiences by how they were acquired

A **Segment** is a saved filter that dynamically groups contacts based on behavior, metadata, or status.

- You create them by applying filters like: “Has opened an email in last 7 days,” “Was tagged `warm_lead`,” etc.

- Segments are perfect for re-engagement or automation targeting

A **Tag** is a simple label you attach to a contact (or group of contacts) to track their status, source, or behavior.

- Tags are the most flexible tool for labeling contacts

- Mark contacts for inclusion/exclusion in future campaigns

- Trigger follow-ups based on actions (e.g., “tag if replied”)

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature | Static or Dynamic? | Editable? | Best For |
| **List** | Static | Manual | Uploading or grouping data sources |
| **Segment** | Dynamic | Filtered logic | Live audiences based on behavior |
| **Tag** | Flexible | Manual or Automated | Labeling by status, action, or source |

### If You're Sending Cold Emails (Recommended for Outreach)
<a id="activateTM-if-youre-sending-cold-emails-recommended-for-outreach"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/3---create-first-email/5fuJj2psGbD3p9QMEQADLG

Once your domain, sender profiles, and contact list are in place, you’re ready to send your first campaign using an **Email Blast**. This is where you define your audience, select lists or segments, and configure any exclusions or suppression logic.

You’ll now be prompted to configure the core settings for your campaign:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Field | Description |
| **Blast Name** | Internal-only name to identify this send (e.g., “July Cold Outreach – SaaS”) |
| **Suppression List (Optional)** | Choose a predefined suppression list to ensure these contacts never receive this blast |
| **Exclude List (Optional)** | Manually exclude specific lists of contacts from this blast |
| **Lists** | Select one or more contact lists to include (e.g., “Demo Leads”, “NY Prospects”) |
| **Segments** | Include specific segments you've tagged or filtered (e.g., “High Intent”, “Opted-in”, etc.) |
| **Exclude Segments (Optional)** | Prevent a segment (e.g., “Existing Clients”, “Past Replies”) from receiving this blast |

AudienceSend will only send the blast to users who:

- Exist in one of the selected **Lists** or **Segments**, and

- Are **not** in any of the excluded lists, segments, or suppression lists

2. You’ll be taken to the email editor where you can:

Now that you’ve selected your audience and clicked **Next**, it’s time to write the actual email that will be sent to your list.

This step is critical — how you structure your message can dramatically affect deliverability, response rate, and even whether your email reaches the inbox at all.

Cold emails must look personal, text-based, and authentic — as if you typed them yourself. To maximize deliverability:

- Write **short, clear sentences** that match natural human tone

- Use **line breaks** between paragraphs (no indentation or formatting)

- Keep your signature simple (just a name or name + title)

##### 🚫 Avoid These Deliverability Killers

- No HTML styling (bold/italic colors, tables, buttons)

- Merge tags like `{{first_name}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{sender_name}}`

```plain
Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} your team at {{company}} is hiring.
```

##### If You’re Sending Warm Emails or Newsletters

If you're emailing a **permission-based list** (like blog subscribers or customers), you can use richer formatting.

**HTML Editor** for developers
**Drag-and-Drop Builder** for design-friendly layout

- Use a single-column layout for mobile responsiveness

- Still avoid Bitly or link trackers unless AudienceSend handles them natively

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use Case | Editor to Use | Style |
| Cold Outreach | Plain Text (default) | No HTML, no images |
| Warm Newsletter | Drag-and-Drop or HTML | Clean, responsive layout |
| Reactivating Users | Plain Text | Looks like a personal email |

#### Code snippets

```
Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} your team at {{company}} is hiring.
```

### Using Spintax to Personalize Cold Emails
<a id="activateTM-using-spintax-to-personalize-cold-emails"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/4---generating-spintax/5fuJj2psGeq3nGWX3zUGxQ

Spintax helps make every email look unique — without writing dozens of variations manually.

AudienceSend supports Spintax in subject lines and body copy, so you can rotate language automatically and improve deliverability by avoiding duplicate content patterns.

Spintax stands for “spinning syntax.” It’s a way to write multiple versions of a word, phrase, or sentence using a single line of text. When the campaign sends, AudienceSend randomly selects one option for each contact.

Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} that {{company}} is growing.
```

Resulting in a natural-looking variation every time.

##### How the Spintax Token Generator Works

1. Place your cursor inside the subject or body field

2. Click the **Spintax Token Generator** icon (usually a `{}` symbol)

You can use multiple tokens across the email to spin greetings, verbs, closings, and even call-to-actions.

##### How to Generate Your Own Spintax (Manual or Free Tools)

If you prefer to control the phrasing yourself or want to generate variations externally:

##### Option 1: Use a Free Spintax Generator

##### Option 2: Use ChatGPT to Generate It

2. **Paste** it into ChatGPT (or any AI writing assistant).

3. **Replace**`[YOUR SERVICE OR OFFER]` and `[YOUR IDEAL AUDIENCE]` with your specifics.

4. **Submit** and get a spintax-formatted cold email template for use in your outreach platform.

Write a cold email template for [YOUR SERVICE OR OFFER], targeting [YOUR IDEAL AUDIENCE].

For each key phrase or sentence, give me 10-20 alternative variations in [option1|option2|option3|...] spintax format so I can use this email with a cold email sending platform.

Use merge tags like {{first_name}} or {{company_name}} where appropriate.

The final output should be a full cold email template, ready to copy and paste, using this spintax format throughout the email.
```

Write a cold email template for AI automation services, targeting small business owners.

Use merge tags like {{first_name}} or {{company_name}} where appropriate.

The final output should be a full cold email template, ready to copy and paste, using this spintax format throughout the email.
```

- Use merge tags (e.g., `{{first_name}}`, `{{company_name}}`) for easy personalization.

- Most cold email tools (Instantly, Lemlist, Smartlead, etc.) accept this `[option1|option2|...]` spintax format.

#### Code snippets

```
{Option A|Option B|Option C}
```
```
Hi {{first_name}}, I {noticed|saw|read} that {{company}} is growing.
```
```
{hello|hi|hey}
```
```

### After Sending: Where to Track Performance
<a id="activateTM-after-sending-where-to-track-performance"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/5---sending-email-/5fuJj2psGd4HbmS8WQizU4

Once you’ve written and reviewed your email inside the Blast Editor, the final step is to either send it now or schedule it for later.

AudienceSend gives you both options, with full control over timing and delivery behavior.

1. After finalizing your email content, scroll to the bottom of the Blast Editor

- **Preview**: View the message exactly as it will appear

- AudienceSend will begin sending the campaign right away to your selected recipients

- Select a **future date and time** for the email to go out

- You can check the **Perfect Timing** box to let AudienceSend deliver each email when a recipient is most likely to open it — within a rolling 24-hour window based on past engagement patterns

Once your blast is scheduled or sent, you can monitor its status and results under:

- Click the three dots (⋮) to edit or manage each one

- Track performance metrics like opens, replies, clicks, and bounces

Before sending your blast to your actual list, it's best practice to send a test email to yourself or your team. This helps you confirm that formatting, links, personalization tokens, and layout all appear as expected — and lets you catch grammar or design errors early.

- Validates visual formatting (especially across email clients)

- Verifies that tokens like `{{first_name}}` and `{{company}}` render correctly

- Prevents deliverability or display issues caused by untested HTML or spintax

- Ensures your content is polished before it hits real inboxes

##### How to Send a Test Email in AudienceSend

5. Optionally, click the **"+" icon** to add additional email addresses for teammates or preview inboxes

You’ll receive a copy of the exact email that will go out — including subject, formatting, dynamic fields, and links — so you can check for issues before final scheduling or delivery.

### Build Automations to Trigger Personalized Sequences
<a id="activateTM-build-automations-to-trigger-personalized-sequences"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/6---automation-flows/5fuJj2psGbEt2qiv6Ybvan

Automations in AudienceSend allow you to create logic-based flows that trigger actions like sending emails, tagging contacts, waiting between steps, or routing users based on behavior. You can use automations to send follow-ups, onboard new subscribers, or segment leads based on engagement.

5. Choose whether or not to allow it to **retrigger** (i.e., should contacts re-enter the same automation in the future?)

6. Click **Create & Build** to open the Automation Builder

- **Connect** blocks by dragging arrows from one to the next

2. Choose a **List** or **Segment** that the automation should apply to

- Only contacts entering that list or segment will activate this automation

Filters allow you to run logic based on conditions like contact info or behavior.

Contact Info (e.g., email, tag, list)
Engagement (e.g., Last Opened)

You can chain filters together to create compound logic.

Events let you trigger flows based on user behavior + delays.

3. Set the **wait time** before the action should trigger

You can define what actions AudienceSend should take once a filter or event is true.

Double-click to open the editor
Name the email, write content, click **OK**

Use this to monitor activity (e.g., “if opened within 2 days, do X”)

Automatically copy or move contacts to a new list at any stage

Drag in a **Split** step and set a percentage to divide traffic for A/B testing

Use this to POST data to external tools (e.g., CRMs, Slack)

Add or remove tags based on actions (e.g., “add `replied` tag if clicked”)

- Used for drip sequences, pause before follow-up, etc.

- The final step of any automation is **Remove Contact**

- This stops further action and exits the contact from the automation

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/activate%E2%84%A2/5fuJj2psGdCYLaEPRb66Mw/7---sign-up-forms/5fuJj2psGdLeS24QEyUUKi

Sign-up forms (also called **Opt-In Forms**) are embedded forms or pop-ups you can use to collect new contacts directly into AudienceSend. These forms can be used for lead generation, newsletter subscriptions, webinar registrations, or gated content access.

A Sign-Up Form is a web-based form that collects user information such as:

- Optional custom fields (e.g., phone number, company, etc.)

Once submitted, the data is saved to your AudienceSend contact database and automatically added to a list you choose.

3. Choose from one of the **predefined form templates**

- Add **Input Fields** like first name, phone number, job title

- Drag in additional elements like headlines, checkboxes, or descriptions

- Click on any element to edit the text, style, font, and formatting

5. Once you've styled the form the way you want, click **Next**

You can choose what happens when someone submits the form:

2. **Show a Thank You Message** directly on the page

- **List Selection** – Choose which AudienceSend list the new contacts should be added to

**Single Opt-In**: The contact enters their info and is subscribed immediately
**Double Opt-In**: The contact must click a confirmation link sent to their email

> Important: Double Opt-In is often recommended for compliance and better engagement quality.

2. You’ll be given a **URL** and/or **embed code** to place the form on your website

You can also connect the form to autoresponders or automations after publishing.

2. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to any form to:

### Step 1: Prepare a Webhook Testing URL
<a id="audiencesync-cdp-step-1-prepare-a-webhook-testing-url"></a>

**How to Set Up an HTTP Destination for a Webhook Test in AudienceSync**

This guide walks you through the exact steps to set up and test an HTTP destination using [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) with AudienceSync.

##### ✅ Step 1: Prepare a Webhook Testing URL

2. Copy the unique URL provided (e.g., `https://webhook.site/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)

3. This will be your temporary HTTP destination to catch and inspect POST requests.

##### ✅ Step 2: Create a New HTTP Destination in AudienceSync

1. Navigate to `Destinations → Add Destination → HTTP`

Click **"Add Header"**
For each header, map the **Key** and **Value**:

`Content-Type` → `application/json`
_(Optional)_`Authorization` → `Bearer test123token456`

> 🔐 You must explicitly map each header field in the destination setup screen. This ensures that the headers are included correctly in every outgoing request to the webhook or API endpoint.

In AudienceSync's destination setup screen, you'll see a section labeled **"Headers"**. Here, you must manually define each header by specifying a key-value pair. These headers are sent along with the HTTP request and are often required by APIs for proper request handling, authentication, or even routing.

##### 🔧 Examples of Header Mappings (Including User Data Fields)

Sometimes you'll see custom headers that begin with `x-`, like `x-user-name`. The `x-` prefix is a conventional way to indicate that a header is non-standard or proprietary — in other words, it's not part of the official HTTP specification like `Content-Type` or `Authorization`.

You **do not need** to use the `x-` prefix unless the destination API specifically requires it. It's just a naming convention. If you're sending metadata like a user's name, email, or phone number, and the receiving endpoint expects plain field names, you can name the headers without the `x-` prefix — such as `name`, `email`, or `phone_number`.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header Key | Header Value | Purpose |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Tells the server the format of the request body |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer your_token_here` | Required for Bearer token authentication |
| `name` | `John Doe` | Custom metadata: user's name passed in header |
| `email` | `john@example.com` | Custom metadata: user's email passed in header |
| `phone_number` | `+15551234567` | Custom metadata: user's phone number passed in header |
| `x-user-email` | `john@example.com` | Custom metadata: user's email passed in header |
| `x-user-phone` | `+15551234567` | Custom metadata: user's phone number passed in header |

> ⚠️ Note: AudienceSync may not support dynamic templating ({{ event.data.\* }}) inside headers. Use static values unless explicitly documented otherwise.

- Do **not** use quotes around keys or values unless the receiving API specifically requires them.

- If you're unsure what headers are needed, consult the documentation for the API you’re integrating with.

- Headers are key for authentication (e.g., Bearer tokens), content negotiation (`Accept`), or routing metadata (like user ID, email, etc.).

Correctly setting these headers is critical for successful integration, especially when dealing with platforms like HubSpot, Slack, or custom APIs expecting contextual user data. for successful integration, especially when dealing with platforms like HubSpot, Slack, or any service requiring authentication or specific content formats.. This ensures headers are correctly included in the request to the webhook or API endpoint.

- **Stream Name**: Select the name of the destination stream (e.g., `http`)

- **Sync Mode**: Choose `incremental` or `full_refresh`

- **Cursor Field**: Optional — use if syncing incrementally based on a timestamp

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Audience Field | HTTP Field |
| `EMAIL` | `email` |
| `FIRST_NAME` | `first_name` |
| `COMPANY` | `company` |

> These define the keys that will appear in your outgoing JSON payload.

```plain
{
  "email": "{{ event.data.email }}",
  "first_name": "{{ event.data.first_name }}",
  "company": "{{ event.data.company }}",
  "timestamp": "{{ event.timestamp }}"
}
```

You can adjust field names to match your column names from the audience query.

2. Go to the destination and click **"Test Destination"**.

3. Watch the Webhook.site page for the incoming request.

- Headers including `Content-Type` and `Authorization` if added

- Always use `snake_case` for outgoing HTTP field names

- Double-check that mapped fields in your sync match what you're using in the body template

- You must map headers explicitly in the destination setup for them to be sent

- For testing Bearer tokens, any dummy token is acceptable on Webhook.site

You're now ready to send real data or integrate with production APIs like HubSpot by adjusting the destination URL and body format.

This guide is designed as a flexible **template** for testing and integrating HTTP destinations in AudienceSync. If you're connecting to a real API:

- ✅ Replace the Webhook.site URL with the real API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts`)

- ✅ Adjust the headers (e.g., correct `Authorization` token, custom headers, etc.)

- ✅ Update the body template to match the required schema for that API

- ✅ Review the destination API documentation to ensure you send exactly what it expects

Every API has different expectations, so be sure to reference the relevant docs and adjust your setup accordingly.

#### Code snippets

```
{
  "email": "{{ event.data.email }}",
  "first_name": "{{ event.data.first_name }}",
  "company": "{{ event.data.company }}",
  "timestamp": "{{ event.timestamp }}"
}
```
```

```
```

### Frequently Asked Questions For AudienceSync CDP
<a id="faq-frequently-asked-questions-for-audiencesync-cdp"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/faq/4NYS4Rtcnb5ie5ogTHmETZ/audiencesync-cdp/4NYS4RtcncEvnba18Qp8P7

#### ❓ Why is my sync stuck in progress or syncing very slowly?

This typically happens when your query runs too frequently, such as every few minutes, which can **overload the system**.

👉 **Recommendation:** Set your queries to run **every 1–3 days**. Since the data refreshes only once per day, running the query more frequently offers no additional benefit and may slow down processing for other syncs.

This occurs when the **primary key** used in your model is **not included in your sync configuration**.

✅ Make sure the **primary key** (e.g., `user_id`, `email`) is present both in your model and in the sync settings. This ensures the system can properly identify and track each record, preventing unnecessary skips.

#### ❓ Why does the sync show 0 rows processed even though it’s active?

This often means you’re using a **cursor field that doesn’t exist** in your data source.

📌 For example, if your sync is configured to track changes using a field like `updated_at`, but that field is missing or empty, no records will be found or processed.

➡️ **Solution:** Double-check that the cursor field:

- Is consistently populated with valid values (e.g., timestamps)

#### ❓ Why isn't my Facebook destination syncing properly?

This is typically caused by using the **wrong Audience ID**.

✅ **Do use** the **Audience ID from your Facebook Ad Account** (found in Ads Manager).

- ✅ Correct: `23842999999930541` (from Facebook Ads Manager)

- ❌ Incorrect: `aud_32903_audience_lab_sync` (from AudienceLab platform)

#### ❓ Why can’t I map fields when syncing to Google Sheets?

This happens when the Google Sheet is missing essential structure.

- Make sure the first row contains **headers** (e.g., `email`, `name`, `timestamp`)

- Include at least **one row of sample data** below the headers

🛠 Without this structure, the system cannot detect or display the available fields for mapping.

#### ❓ Why are only 1,000–10,000 rows syncing while thousands are skipped?

The sync only sends **net new records** each time it runs.

➡️ The sync will process and send only those 1,500 new records

🧠 **Tip:** If you want to resend all records (including old ones):

#### Code snippets

```
aud_32903_audience_lab_sync

### 🔁 Syncs Overview – Understanding Data Syncs in AudienceSync

**Syncs** define how your data is **transferred and mapped** from its source to its destination within **AudienceSync**.

- A **destination** (where the data should be delivered).

AudienceSync supports **two sync types**, each serving different use cases:

- **What it does:** Replaces _all_ the data in the destination with the data from the source.

- **When to use it:** When you want to completely overwrite the destination with the latest version from your source.

- **What it does:** Syncs only the data that has **changed since the last sync**.

- **When to use it:** Ideal for keeping your destination up to date with **only new or updated records** without overwriting existing data.

In **AudienceSync**, **streams** refer to the **destination APIs or objects** you are syncing data to.

Each stream represents a different target object in the destination platform where specific data types are synced.

---

### 🔁 Incremental Syncs with Cursor Field – Minimizing Data Transfer in AudienceSync

AudienceSync supports an optimized **Incremental Sync** mode using a **Cursor Field**. This allows you to transfer **only new or updated records** by leveraging a field that tracks changes over time—resulting in **faster syncs** and **less data duplication**.

> 🔍 This feature is only available for sources that support cursor fields (currently only date fields are supported).

A **Cursor Field** acts as a **timestamp marker** to track what data has changed since the last sync.

- Ensures only **modified or added records** are synced.

- Enables the system to **resume exactly where it left off**.

- Optimizes performance and reduces API strain or data volume.

> ⚠️ Do not edit or remove a cursor field after setup—it may cause data loss or disrupt sync integrity.

#### ⚖️ Handling Ambiguity & Inclusive Cursors

If the cursor field is too coarse (e.g., tracks **only dates**), distinguishing between **old and new records** within the same day may be difficult.

We implement **"at least once delivery"**—so even if there's ambiguity, data is **safely re-sent**. It avoids missing updates but may result in duplicates, which should be handled downstream.

- If a record changes **without updating the cursor field**, it **will not be picked up** in incremental syncs.

- **Editing or deleting** a cursor field **breaks the tracking system**, leading to **potential data loss or inconsistencies**.

> 🧷 To maintain sync reliability: Never change or remove the cursor field after configuration.

#### Code snippets

```sql
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-20 10:00:00';
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-20 11:00:00';
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE updated_at >= '2024-04-21 10:00:00';
```

### 🔁 Full Refresh Syncs – How They Work in AudienceSync

**Full Refresh** is a sync mode in **AudienceSync** used when you want to **completely replace existing data** in the destination with new data from the source.

This method retrieves **all available data**, regardless of what was previously synced, ensuring the destination always holds a **full, current snapshot** of the source.

- You want to **overwrite** all data in the destination.

- You need a **clean slate** with the latest source data.

- It’s okay to **lose old records** that are no longer present in the source.

- The system **deletes existing rows** in the destination table.

- It then inserts the **entire dataset** from the source.

Let’s say the destination contains a `Users` table:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | name | email |
| 1 | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 2 | Bob | bob@example.com |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | name | email |
| 1 | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 3 | Carol | carol@example.com |
| 4 | Dave | dave@example.com |

> 📝 Notice: Bob's record was removed, and new users Carol and Dave were added.

### 📄 Google Sheets (Service Account) – Destination Setup in AudienceSync

**Google Sheets** is a collaborative, low-barrier destination for real-time data syncing from data warehouses. With AudienceSync, you can push data into Google Sheets to **empower non-technical teams**, enable **custom reporting**, and foster a **data-driven culture**.

> ⚠️ Important: Google Sheets is ideal for lightweight, non-critical syncs due to platform limitations.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Constraint | Limit |
| **Cell Limit** | 10 million cells per document |
| **Characters per Cell** | 50,000 |
| **Columns per Sheet** | 18,278 |
| **Worksheets per Spreadsheet** | 200 |

> 🛑 Exceeding any of these may result in sync failures. For large datasets, consider alternate destinations.

- Admin access to configure **Google APIs** and **Service Accounts**

- Choose an existing project or **create a new one**

Enter a **name** and **description**
Click **Create and Continue**

##### 2\. **Generate a Service Account Key**

> 🔐 HubSpot private apps enable secure API access with fine-grained permissions.

##### 1\. **Locate the Private Apps Section**

- **Description:** Briefly describe your app’s purpose

- Use the **search bar** to find specific data types

- Select **"Write"** access for the necessary scopes (e.g., Contacts, Companies, Deals)

- After creation, HubSpot will show your **access token**

- Paste the **access token** into the **AudienceSync destination configuration** for HubSpot

### 🔁 Incremental Syncs – Syncing Only New or Updated Data in AudienceSync

**Incremental syncs** transfer only the data that has **changed since the last sync**—this includes **new or updated records**, minimizing data transfer and reducing redundancy.

This method avoids resending previously synced data by using a **unique primary key** and a reliable update-tracking field (like `updated_at`).

> 📝 Note: The first incremental sync behaves like a full refresh because all data is considered new.

1. A **unique primary key** (set during model creation) is used to identify each row.

2. AudienceSync checks for changes using a column like `updated_at`, `modified`, or `timestamp`.

3. Only **new or modified rows** are included in each sync.

4. Destination data is **updated or appended** as needed.

### 📘 Model Overview – Creating Models in AudienceSync

Models in **AudienceSync** help you **define and organize data** from multiple sources, making it easier to build efficient, query-ready datasets.

This guide walks you through the **end-to-end model creation process**—from selecting a data source to defining your model using SQL, Table Selector, or dbt.

#### 🗂️ Understanding the Model Creation Workflow

The model-building process in AudienceSync is streamlined across six main steps:

#### ✅ Step 1: Navigate to the Models Section

- Choose a connected data warehouse from your list of integrations.

- This will serve as the foundation for your model.

- **SQL Query** – Write a custom query to define your model.

- **Table Selector** – Use a visual interface for building models.

- **dbt Model** – Reference prebuilt dbt models for advanced transformation.

- Click **Run Query** to preview results and confirm the structure.

- Provide a **descriptive name** and **brief description** for clarity and future reference.

- A unique key ensures **each record** can be uniquely identified.

- It's critical for **accurate data synchronization**—tracking only **new or updated rows**.

- During model setup, select a column with **unique values**.

- If no such column exists, consider creating a **composite key** or transforming the data to ensure uniqueness.

Once complete, your model is ready for activation within **AudienceSync**!

### 🧠 Data Normalization Templates (AudienceSync)

This guide walks you through two templates for exploding comma-separated fields inside **AudienceSync**. Both templates help you normalize messy audience data for upload to platforms like Facebook Ads, TikTok, or CRMs.

58 sec⚡️1 min 13 sec58 sec48 sec39 sec34 sec29 sec23 sec

Note: Make sure to leave no unnecessary spaces when pasting in the queries.

#### 📦 Template 1: **Explode Values Template**

You have a **single column** with **comma-separated values** (e.g., `hash1,hash2,hash3`) and want to **split it into multiple rows**, one value per row.

- Uses `STRING_SPLIT(..., ',')` to break values into an array.

- Uses `TRIM(...)` and `WHERE` filters to clean empty/blank values.

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  TRIM(value) AS sha256_personal_email
FROM (
  SELECT
    UNNEST(STRING_SPLIT(SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL, ',')) AS value
  FROM all_sources
)
WHERE value IS NOT NULL
  AND value <> '';
```

> 🔁 Replace SHA256\_PERSONAL\_EMAIL with your column name

You have multiple fields (e.g., `SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL`, `MOBILE_PHONE`, etc.) containing **comma-separated values**, and you need:

- Static fields (like `FIRST_NAME`) repeated for each row

- Uses `COALESCE(...)` to select the first non-empty email or phone

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SHA256\_PERSONAL\_EMAIL | SHA256\_BUSINESS\_EMAIL | MOBILE\_PHONE | FIRST\_NAME |
| hash1,hash2 | hash3 | 1111,2222,3333 | Alice |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| normal\_email | normal\_phone | FIRST\_NAME |
| hash1 | 1111 | Alice |
| hash2 | 2222 | Alice |
| hash3 | 3333 | Alice |

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  -- Combined Email Field
  COALESCE(
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_sha256[idx]), ''),
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_sha256_business_email[idx]), '')
  ) AS normal_email,

-- Combined Phone Field
  COALESCE(
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_mobile_phone[idx]), ''),
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_personal_phone[idx]), ''),
    NULLIF(TRIM(split_direct_number[idx]), '')
  ) AS normal_phone,

-- Static fields (not exploded)
  FIRST_NAME,
  LAST_NAME,
  PERSONAL_CITY,
  PERSONAL_STATE,
  PERSONAL_ZIP,
  GENDER
FROM (
  SELECT
    -- Splitting multi-value fields
    split(SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL, ',') AS split_sha256,
    split(PERSONAL_EMAILS, ',') AS split_emails,
    split(DIRECT_NUMBER, ',') AS split_direct_number,
    split(MOBILE_PHONE, ',') AS split_mobile_phone,
    split(PERSONAL_PHONE, ',') AS split_personal_phone,
    split(SHA256_BUSINESS_EMAIL, ',') AS split_sha256_business_email,

-- Static fields passed through
    FIRST_NAME,
    LAST_NAME,
    PERSONAL_CITY,
    PERSONAL_STATE,
    PERSONAL_ZIP,
    GENDER,

-- Index list for row explosion
    range(
      0,
      GREATEST(
        array_length(split(SHA256_PERSONAL_EMAIL, ',')),
        array_length(split(PERSONAL_EMAILS, ',')),
        array_length(split(DIRECT_NUMBER, ',')),
        array_length(split(MOBILE_PHONE, ',')),
        array_length(split(PERSONAL_PHONE, ',')),
        array_length(split(SHA256_BUSINESS_EMAIL, ','))
      )
    ) AS idx_list
  FROM all_sources
) t,
UNNEST(idx_list) AS idx_struct(idx)
WHERE (
  (split_sha256[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_sha256[idx] <> '')
  OR (split_sha256_business_email[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_sha256_business_email[idx] <> '')
)
AND (
  (split_mobile_phone[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_mobile_phone[idx] <> '')
  OR (split_personal_phone[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_personal_phone[idx] <> '')
  OR (split_direct_number[idx] IS NOT NULL AND split_direct_number[idx] <> '')
);
```

- Combines **SHA256\_PERSONAL\_EMAIL** and **SHA256\_BUSINESS\_EMAIL** into a single column called `normal_email`

- Merges **MOBILE\_PHONE**, **PERSONAL\_PHONE**, and **DIRECT\_NUMBER** into a single `normal_phone`

- Retains static fields like `FIRST_NAME`, `ZIP`, and `GENDER`

- Ensures one clean value per row — exactly what Facebook, TikTok, and Google expect

### 🧠 Template 3: **State and Field Selection Template (AudienceSync)**

This template shows you how to **select specific fields** based on **geography or attribute filters**, like `PERSONAL_STATE = 'NY'`.

It’s designed for simple but powerful selections inside **AudienceSync**.

#### 📦 Template 3: **State and Field Selection**

You need to pull a specific subset of records based on a **filter condition** like "State = NY", "State = CA", or any other field match.

- Pick the fields you want to SELECT (e.g., emails, names, phones).

- Use a simple `WHERE` clause to filter by state, gender, or any attribute.

- AudienceSync will return only matching rows — clean and ready for export or processing.

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  FIELD1,
  FIELD2,
  FIELD3
FROM all_sources
WHERE FILTER_COLUMN = 'your_filter_value';
```

> 🔁 Replace FIELD1, FIELD2, FILTER\_COLUMN, and 'your\_filter\_value'

### 📚 Example 1: Select Emails and Names Where State is NY

Pull `PERSONAL_EMAILS`, `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME` only for users in **New York**.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PERSONAL\_EMAILS | FIRST\_NAME | LAST\_NAME | PERSONAL\_STATE |
| alice@example.com | Alice | Johnson | NY |
| bob@example.com | Bob | Smith | CA |
| dave@example.com | Dave | Wilson | NY |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PERSONAL\_EMAILS | FIRST\_NAME | LAST\_NAME |
| alice@example.com | Alice | Johnson |
| dave@example.com | Dave | Wilson |

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  PERSONAL_EMAILS,
  FIRST_NAME,
  LAST_NAME
FROM all_sources
WHERE PERSONAL_STATE = 'NY';
```

### 📚 Example 2: Select Mobile Phones Where State is CA

Pull `MOBILE_PHONE` and `FIRST_NAME` only for users in **California**.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MOBILE\_PHONE | FIRST\_NAME | PERSONAL\_STATE |
| 1234567890 | Alice | CA |
| 0987654321 | Bob | NY |
| 5551234567 | Carol | CA |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| MOBILE\_PHONE | FIRST\_NAME |
| 1234567890 | Alice |
| 5551234567 | Carol |

##### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  MOBILE_PHONE,
  FIRST_NAME
FROM all_sources
WHERE PERSONAL_STATE = 'CA';
```

- Quickly segment users by state for regional marketing pushes.

### 📦 Template 4: **First Email from Raw Text** (AudienceSync)

Extract the **first email address** from a messy, comma-separated list in the `PERSONAL_EMAILS` field — even when formatting is inconsistent (spaces, no quotes, weird separators, etc.).

This version is fast, reliable, and does **not require splitting arrays** or cleaning input manually.

- `PERSONAL_EMAILS` contains multiple emails in one string

- Formatting is inconsistent (e.g., `email1, email2`, or `"email1" , email2`)

```plain
srmatthews1967@gmail.com, marhodes34@gmail.com, sharon.matthews@att.net
```

```plain
   first@example.com , second@example.com  , third@example.com
```

#### ✅ Copy & Paste Version (for AudienceSync)

```sql
SELECT
  FIRST_NAME,
  LAST_NAME,
  PERSONAL_ADDRESS,
  PERSONAL_CITY,
  PERSONAL_STATE,
  PERSONAL_ZIP,

-- Extract the first valid email pattern
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(PERSONAL_EMAILS, '[^, ]+@[^, ]+') AS first_personal_email,

SKIPTRACE_WIRELESS_NUMBERS,
  SKIPTRACE_DNC
FROM all_sources
WHERE SKIPTRACE_WIRELESS_NUMBERS IS NOT NULL
  AND SKIPTRACE_WIRELESS_NUMBERS <> ''
  AND PERSONAL_EMAILS IS NOT NULL
  AND PERSONAL_EMAILS <> '';
```

- `REGEXP_EXTRACT(..., '[^, ]+@[^, ]+')` finds the first **valid-looking email** — skipping spaces and commas

- Works **even if**`PERSONAL_EMAILS` is sloppy, inconsistent, or has mixed delimiters

- 🔄 Want to get the **second** email instead? Use `regexp_extract_all(...)[1]`

- 🧼 Want to force lowercase? Wrap with `LOWER(...)`

- 💡 Want to use this on another field? Just swap `PERSONAL_EMAILS` with any column

#### Code snippets

### 📘 SQL Editor Guide – Defining Models with AudienceSync

The SQL Editor in **AudienceSync** lets you **define and manage data models** using native SQL queries compatible with your data warehouse. This offers a flexible, powerful way to shape data for activation and analysis.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data.customers
```

- Click **Preview** to load the **first 100 rows**.

> ⚠️ Note: You cannot save the model if the query is invalid or returns no data.

Every model **must** have a **unique primary key**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer_data
GROUP BY unique_identifier_column
```

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       email,
       purchase_date,
       MD5(CONCAT(customer_id, '-', email)) AS composite_key
FROM sales_data
```

If your model currently has no data but will in the future, use:

```sql
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_dataset
WHERE important_column1 IS NOT NULL AND important_column2 IS NOT NULL
```

Replace `important_column1`, `important_column2`, etc., with your actual field names.

#### Code snippets

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data.customers
```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer_data
GROUP BY unique_identifier_column
```
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       email,
       purchase_date,
       MD5(CONCAT(customer_id, '-', email)) AS composite_key
FROM sales_data
```
```sql
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_dataset
WHERE important_column1 IS NOT NULL AND important_column2 IS NOT NULL
```

### Step-by-Step Guide: Extract the First Value from Any Comma-Separated Field in Make.com
<a id="audiencelab-v3-step-by-step-guide-extract-the-first-value-from-any-comma-separat"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/audiencelab-v3/4KR8gkKWfJNWx7Xncc7dwK/extracting-first-values-makecom/4Mc1KyutA5i2sHvsBQ2HoX

4 min⚡️4 min 36 sec3 min 41 sec3 min 4 sec2 min 27 sec2 min 10 sec1 min 50 sec1 min 28 sec

This guide shows you how to extract **only the first value** from any field that contains multiple comma-separated entries (like emails, phone numbers, tags, etc.) using **Make.com**. This is perfect for sending just the primary value to tools like **Instantly**, **Google Sheets**, **Airtable**, or **Slack**.

```plain
BUSINESS_EMAIL = "john@example.com, support@brand.com, info@brand.com"
→ Extracted: john@example.com
```

```plain
MOBILE = "1234567890, 9876543210"
→ Extracted: 1234567890
```

```plain
TAGS = "sales, marketing, enterprise"
→ Extracted: sales
```

##### STEP 1: Webhook (or Any Input Source)

Make sure the field (like `BUSINESS_EMAIL` or `MOBILE`) contains values **separated by commas**.

##### STEP 2: Add an Iterator (if your data is bundled)

If your webhook sends data in an array (e.g. `result[]`):

##### STEP 3: Set Variable – Extract the First Value

Create a variable for each field where you want only the first value:

```plain
Variable Name: FirstEmail
Value: {{trim(get(split(2.BUSINESS_EMAIL; ","); 1))}}
```

```plain
Variable Name: FirstMobile
Value: {{trim(get(split(2.MOBILE; ","); 1))}}
```

```plain
Variable Name: FirstTag
Value: {{trim(get(split(2.TAGS; ","); 1))}}
```

_Update the_`2.` _reference depending on your scenario (it refers to the previous module number)._

- **Google Sheets** → Email column: `{{3.FirstEmail}}`

- You can safely apply this pattern to **any text field**

- Works even without an Iterator if you're processing one record at a time

Copy-paste this into any `Set Variable` value field:

```plain
{{trim(get(split(YOUR_FIELD; ","); 1))}}
```

This method gives you a clean, consistent way to always pull just the **first value** from any multi-entry string. It’s reusable across:

Set it once, and confidently send only the data you actually want to downstream tools.

Welcome to the latest version of **AudienceLab (V3)**!

It’s been 3 years since V1—and V3 is the most powerful, streamlined version yet.

This guide includes everything you need to **log in, navigate key changes**, and **start activating data** like a pro.

You’ll receive an access email containing a personal invite link like this:

```plain
https://build.audiencelab.io/auth/sign-up?code=YOURCODE
```

- You’ll need to **create a new login** (use your existing credentials).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Purpose |
| `build.audiencelab.io` | **V3** (new version) |
| `app.audiencelab.io` | **V2** (legacy platform) |
| `cdp.audiencelab.io` | **Customer Data Platform** |

> ⚠️ This is temporary. Soon, everything will be merged under:

Click **“Preview”** to explore and refine your audience before syncing.

- If you previously had access to just B2B, it will appear automatically.

All intent types (premade, keyword, and custom models) are now inside a **single filter**.

- Keywords are now scored using **embedding models**.

- This means we measure **context + semantics**, not just keyword matches.

A **new V3 pixel** is in testing with advanced capabilities.

Until release, you can still use and manage your pixel inside **V3**.

We’ve transitioned from traditional APIs toward **activation via a CDP** (Customer Data Platform) — the **industry standard** for secure, scalable data activation.

> 🧪 Beta Notice: AudienceSync is still under development. Bugs may exist, and new integrations are being added regularly.

- You can still use **V2 (app.audiencelab.io)** for syncing during beta.

- Please report any bugs by **creating a support ticket**.

> 🚫 You won’t receive a verification email—just log in right away using your new credentials.

Once logged in, the AudienceSync interface will feel familiar if you've used platforms like **Hightouch** or **Rudderstack**.

### How to Eliminate Noise To Get What You Want
<a id="custom-models-how-to-eliminate-noise-to-get-what-you-want"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/custom-models-/4z72nzTBAcQ8nqMRzSvb33/how-to-eliminate-noise-to-get-what-you-want/4z72nzTBAewfeeA3XzU45g

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but not perfect. They operate across hundreds of billions of URLs and documents, drawing meaning based on statistical context. This means:

> Even slight topic drift introduces massive noise.

If your topic description includes multiple entities, vague terms, or cross-cutting comparisons, you risk training the model on irrelevant or low-signal content.

- **One topic** (e.g., a brand, feature, or outcome)

- **One lens** (e.g., Brand, Function, Service, etc.)

- **One clear paragraph** (no keywords, comparisons, or fluff)

> Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive all offer CRM solutions to help businesses manage their sales pipelines...

- Triggers pages like G2, Capterra, Reddit comparisons

- Creates ambiguity around which product the model should anchor to

> Pipedrive is a sales CRM platform built to help small and mid-sized sales teams track deals, automate workflows, and visualize pipeline stages in real time. The platform includes features like customizable pipelines, deal rotting alerts, workflow automation, and email tracking. Sales managers use Pipedrive to gain visibility into rep activity and forecast revenue, while reps rely on its intuitive interface to manage daily tasks and move deals forward. It integrates with hundreds of tools including Google Workspace, Slack, and Zoom, and is especially popular among B2B startups and agencies looking for a lightweight, scalable CRM.

Outcome: This helps the model learn what Pipedrive _is_, _who it's for_, and _how it's used_.

##### 🤖 Hormozi Example: Going Deep with a Brand Lens

**Better Input**: "Alex Hormozi" with the **Brand Lens**

> Alex Hormozi is an entrepreneur, investor, and business educator best known for founding Acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies generating over $100M in annual revenue. He is the author of $100M Offers and $100M Leads, two bestselling books focused on offer creation and lead generation strategies for entrepreneurs. Through podcasts, long-form content, and speaking engagements, Hormozi shares operational insights, hiring frameworks, and M&A strategies rooted in first-hand experience scaling service-based businesses. He invests in companies that fit his acquisition criteria and mentors founders through content-rich resources under the Acquisition.com brand.

- Trains the model to distinguish _who_ he is _and what he does_

- Surfaces high-value content tied to **intent**, not popularity

### Understanding "Lenses" for Machine Learning Categorization
<a id="custom-models-understanding-lenses-for-machine-learning-categorization"></a>

**Source:** https://docs.audiencelab.io/custom-models-/4z72nzTBAcQ8nqMRzSvb33/understanding-lenses-/4z72nzTBAcCgR5kCsmx8Pg

Lenses are structured semantic perspectives that help categorize a topic based on _how the user or customer sees it_ when they land on a webpage, search for a solution, or consume content.

LLMs aren’t just decoding topics — they’re interpreting **user intent**. So we need to match descriptions to the **perspective a user has** when they arrive at a certain page.

- A user searching for "Apollo.io" is likely trying to learn what the company does (Brand lens)

- A user searching for "cold email deliverability" is trying to solve a problem (Solution lens)

- A user searching for "InboxRamp" is researching a product (Product lens)

By writing with the correct lens, we help the model:

- Avoid noise from comparison pages, forums, or irrelevant media mentions

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lens** | **Focus** | **Cold Email Software** | **Sales & Marketing CRM** | **Conversational AI Tools** |
| **Brand** | Company or named entity | Instantly.ai | Salesforce | Drift |
| **Product** | Specific product or feature | Smart Inbox | HubSpot Sales Starter | Intercom Inbox |
| **Solution** | The outcome the user wants | Cold email deliverability | Revenue pipeline visibility | 24/7 automated support |
| **Function** | What the tool actually does | Domain warm-up rotation | Lead scoring & CAC payback tracking | Natural language intent detection |
| **Service** | How the solution is delivered | Email outreach as-a-service | CRM onboarding and consulting | Bot-building services |
| **Event** | Where users learn or connect | Cold Email Bootcamp | Dreamforce | Conversational AI Summit |

> ✅ Choose ONE lens per topic to minimize ambiguity and maximize precision in model behavior.

### >\> [Access the AI Bot By Clicking Here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6818963b605481918ae71f155b338b4a-audiencelab-models-builder) <<

The AudienceLab AI bot is your shortcut to building clean, high-performing custom model descriptions — fast.

- Write one-paragraph descriptions using our **Clarity5 framework**

- Remove confusion, brand stacking, or persona noise

Whether you're starting from scratch or refining a known idea, the AI bot ensures your models are sharp, structured, and submission-ready.

#### 🧭 How to Use the AI Bot to Build a Custom Model

##### ✅ Step 1: Ask the Bot for a Suggestion

If you’re not sure how to frame your idea, start by asking the bot for a **suggestion**.

> “Give me a suggestion for people looking to refinance their home. Use the Solution lens. Granularity 3.”

The bot will return 2–4 specific, lens-based topic ideas.

- Specify a **lens** (Brand, Product, Function, Service, Solution, or Event)

> “Would you like this to be more specific or less specific?”

Use this prompt to fine-tune the idea before writing the paragraph.

##### ✅ Step 2: Choose Your Favorite Suggested Topic

Pick the topic that best matches the exact behavior you want to model.

> “Give me a suggestion for cold email. Lens: Function. Level 4.”

Now you're ready to generate the model description.

##### ✅ Step 3: Ask the Bot to Write the Model Description

Once your topic is chosen, ask the bot to generate a clean paragraph using **Generation Mode**.

> “Write a custom model for: domain rotation for sender reputation. Use the Function lens. Granularity 5.”

The AI bot will return a one-paragraph description using the **Clarity5 framework**:

> “Automated domain rotation systems that protect sender reputation, maintain cold email deliverability, and reduce blacklist risk for outreach teams scaling across multiple inboxes.”

2. Go to **AudienceLab → Custom Models → Create New**

**Note:** AudienceLab scans over 200 billion URLs per week — but your model only works if your input is sharp. That one paragraph is the signal.

##### ✅ Step 5: Add Filters After the Model is Built

Once your model is approved, you can apply filters to refine who you're targeting.

**Important:** Never include these filters in the model paragraph itself. The model is about _what_ someone is doing — the filters decide _who_ they are.

> “Can you review this for clarity and remove any noise?”

1. Ask the bot for a **suggestion** (intent + lens + granularity)

3. Ask the bot to **generate a one-paragraph description**

4. Paste into the **AudienceLab Custom Model Builder**

5. Apply ICP filters (job title, geo, domain) **after** model creation

> “Give me a suggestion for weight loss behavior. Function lens. Granularity 3.”

> “Write a model for zero-down HVAC financing. Service lens. Level 5.”

> “Review this model and remove any noise or broad terms.”

### 🧭 How to Build Your First Audience in Audience Lab

**Duration:** ~5 minutes \| **Feature:** Audience Lists \| **Difficulty:** Beginner

| Concept | Summary |
| **Audience Lists** | The main place where you’ll create and manage your target audiences from scratch. |
| **Strong Audiences** | Combine _who_ (business type) + _what_ (intent or service interest). |
| **AI Keyword Generator** | Finds companies based on services they offer using natural-language prompts. |
| **Job Title Filters** | Target decision-makers like _Founder, Co-Founder, Owner,_ or _President_. |
| **Intent Layering** | Add “intent” keywords to find users actively searching for a service (e.g., “lead generation”). |
| **Auto Refresh** | Schedule your audience to update daily, weekly, or bi-weekly for fresh data. |

#### 🧩 Step-by-Step: Building Your First Audience

##### **Step 1: Start Building Your Audience (0:27)**

🖱️ **Navigate:**`Left Menu → Audience Lists → Create Audience`

✏️ **Action:** Name your new audience (example: “TikTok Agencies – Lead Gen”).

Start by creating an audience you would _actually_ use — a practical case helps you learn faster.

**Example Goal:** Find _TikTok marketing agencies_ that are _actively looking for lead generation services_.

→ Combines a specific **business type (who)** with a clear **intent (what)**.

##### **Step 2: Define Your Target Market (1:23)**

1. Enter a descriptive phrase — e.g., **“agencies offering TikTok services” (1:47)**
2. Click **Generate → Continue → Preview**

A large, raw audience (often 500K+ records) — this is your _starting point_ before filtering.

##### **Step 3: Refine with Job Titles (2:43)**

Refining by titles typically reduces the list size but increases _relevance_.

In this example: from ~500K → ~60K high-quality contacts.

##### **Step 4: Layer on Intent Data (3:28)**

1. Use the **keyword search** for intent — enter **“lead generation services.”**
2. Click **Generate → Select “Medium” Intent Level (3:49)**

Your list now focuses on people actively looking for lead generation — making it hyper-relevant.

Start with “Medium” intent for balanced reach; “High” is narrower and for final-stage buyers.

##### **Step 5: Finalize and Schedule Your Audience (4:31)**

🖱️ Click **Generate Audience** → Wait for completion.

Set your **refresh schedule** to automatically update data:

Frequent refreshes (1–3 days) are best for fast-moving markets like agencies or SaaS.

| Filter Type | Example | Purpose |
| **Keyword Generator** | “agencies offering TikTok services” | Builds broad audience scope |
| **Job Titles** | Founder, Co-Founder | Focuses on decision-makers |
| **Intent Keywords** | “lead generation” | Finds active service-seekers |
| **Refresh Frequency** | 7 days | Keeps data fresh & relevant |

**Q:** Where do I start building a new audience? _(0:27)_

**A:** Go to **Audience Lists → Create Audience** on the dashboard.

**Q:** How do I find companies that offer a specific service? _(1:47)_

**A:** Use the **AI Keyword Generator** in the Business section — describe what they offer (e.g., “agencies offering TikTok services”).

**A:** It narrows your audience to key decision-makers like founders or owners.

**A:** Intent data identifies users currently researching a specific service or product online.

**Q:** What’s the difference between Low, Medium, and High intent? _(3:49)_

**A:** It measures purchase readiness — “High” = very close to buying; “Medium” = considering; “Low” = early research.

**Q:** How often should I refresh my audience? _(4:58)_

**A:** Choose 1–3 days for fast-changing verticals, or 7–14 days for stable industries.

Building your first audience in **Audience Lab** combines two main ideas:

- **Define who** you’re targeting (via business type + roles).
- **Identify what** they’re looking for (via intent keywords).

Once mastered, this workflow lets you generate dynamic, continuously refreshed lead lists — without repetitive manual work.

### 🚀 Use the Studio Persistent API Endpoint to Export Data

✅ Send your **Studio audience data** to apps like [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), **Zapier**, or **N8N**

✅ Use the **Persistent API URL** with your **Segment ID** \+ **API Key**

✅ Handle large data using **pagination (** **`page`** **,** **`page_size`** **)**

✅ Enable **auto-refresh** (e.g., every 3 days) for always-updated data

✅ Works with any tool that supports **HTTP requests**

How to Use the Studio Persistent API to Send Data to Make.com 🚀

The **Studio Persistent API** allows you to **export audience data directly** to external platforms such as CRMs, automation tools, and campaign systems — all without manual CSV exports.

You’ll learn how to connect **Studio →** [**Make.com**](https://make.com/) (and similar tools) using a simple HTTP request.

```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Persistent API| B[Make.com / Zapier]
B --> C[CRM / Campaign App]
```

Your Studio data flows continuously through the **Persistent API**, staying **fresh and synchronized** across systems.

#### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Data Segment in Studio

##### 🧭 Step 1.1 — Create and Refine Your Segment

1. Go to **Segments** in your Audience Lab account.
2. Choose an existing segment or click **➕ Create New Segment**.
3. Open the segment inside **Studio**.

🪄 **Tip:** Give your segment a clear, descriptive name (e.g., “Cold Campaign – Verified Emails”).

Click **“Build a New Table”** and add the desired columns:

| Field Type | Example Columns |
| 🔤 Identity | `First Name`, `Last Name` |
| 🏢 Company | `Company Name`, `Domain` |
| ✉️ Contact | `Business Verified Email` |
| 📱 Mobile | `Mobile` → use **Extract First Only** |

- `Business Verified Email is not empty`
- `Mobile is not empty`

- Click **Save Card** → name your table (e.g., “Cold Campaign”)
- Click **Load Segment** → confirm rows and columns look correct

#### 2️⃣ Configure the Persistent API Request in [Make.com](https://make.com/)

1. In [**Make.com**](https://make.com/), click **\+ Add Module** → select **HTTP**.
2. Choose **Make a Request**.

| 🔧 Setting | 📝 What to Enter | 💡 Example |
| **Method** | `GET` | — |
| **URL** | [`https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]`](https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]) | Replace `[STUDIOSEGMENTID]` |
| **Query Params** | `page=1`, `page_size=50` | Pulls first 50 records |
| **Header** | `X-API-Key: [YOUR_API_KEY]` | From Audience Lab → _Settings → API Keys_ |
| **Parse Response** | ✅ ON | Enables structured field mapping |

```
GET https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ABC123?page=1&page_size=50
X-API-Key: sk_live_1234567890abcdef
```

📎 This will return a **JSON response** of your segment’s contacts and fields.

1. Go to **Segments** in Audience Lab.
2. Copy the **Segment ID** under your saved segment name.
3. Paste it into your HTTP module’s URL.

Run once → You should now see structured data ready to map to your next module (HubSpot, Instantly, Gmail, etc.).

1. Go back to your **main audience dashboard**.
2. Click the ⚙️ **Settings icon** next to your segment.
3. Enable **Auto Refresh** and set interval → e.g. **Every 3 Days**.

This ensures your Persistent API endpoint always delivers fresh, verified data.

```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Auto Refresh Every 3 Days| B[Persistent API]
B -->|Feeds| C[Connected Apps / Workflows]
```

A: Because the API continuously provides updated data as your segment refreshes — not a one-time snapshot.

A: Yes. Any tool supporting HTTP GET requests works.

A: Exports are static; Persistent API delivers **live, continuously updated data**.

It ensures only the first (and most accurate) mobile number is exported.

Add a filter → **Business Verified Email is not empty.**

Yes — use different keys per integration for better management and security.

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
| 🔸 Data looks incomplete | Pagination limit | Add `page` \+ `page_size` params or loop |
| 🔸 Only raw JSON appears | Parse Response OFF | Turn **Parse Response ON** |
| 🔸 Fewer contacts than expected | Strict filters | Review Studio filters for exclusions |

In [Make.com](https://make.com/), use an iterator or repeater to fetch all pages sequentially.

Create one per connected platform (e.g., Zapier, HubSpot).

| 🎯 Goal | ⚙️ Setup |
| Sync verified leads to HubSpot daily | Persistent API → [Make.com](https://make.com/) → HubSpot Create Contact |
| Auto-update cold outreach lists | Persistent API → Zapier → Instantly |
| Build dynamic ad audiences | Persistent API → N8N → Google Sheets / Meta Ads |

#### Code snippets

```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Persistent API| B[Make.com / Zapier]
B --> C[CRM / Campaign App]
```
```
GET https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/SEGMENT_ABC123?page=1&page_size=50
X-API-Key: sk_live_1234567890abcdef
```
```
A[Studio Segment] -->|Auto Refresh Every 3 Days| B[Persistent API]
B -->|Feeds| C[Connected Apps / Workflows]
```
```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
```
Business Verified Email
```
```
Business Verified Email is not empty
```
```
https://api.audiencelab.io/segments/[STUDIOSEGMENTID]
```
```
X-API-Key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
```
