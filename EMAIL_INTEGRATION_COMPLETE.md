Added 5 new marketplace email templates:
- **PartnerApprovedEmail** - Sent when admin approves a partner application
  - Includes API key display in callout
  - Next steps checklist
  - Dashboard CTA button

  - New balance display (blue styling)
  - Package details table

### 2. ✅ Email Sender Functions Added
**File**: `src/lib/email/service.ts`

Added 5 sender functions following existing patterns:
- `sendPartnerApprovedEmail(email, partnerName, companyName, apiKey)`
- `sendPartnerRejectedEmail(email, partnerName, companyName, reason)`
- `sendPurchaseConfirmationEmail(email, buyerName, purchaseDetails)`
- `sendPayoutCompletedEmail(email, partnerName, payoutDetails)`
- `sendCreditPurchaseConfirmationEmail(email, buyerName, creditDetails)`

All functions:
- Use `renderEmail()` to convert React templates to HTML
- Include proper email tags for categorization
- Return `EmailResult` with success status
- Follow error handling best practices

### 3. ✅ API Routes Wired Up
Integrated email sending into existing API routes with try/catch error handling:

#### Partner Approval
**File**: `src/app/api/admin/partners/[partnerId]/approve/route.ts`
- Sends approval email with API key after partner is activated
- Email failure doesn't block approval process
- Fixed async params for Next.js 15 compatibility

#### Partner Rejection
**File**: `src/app/api/admin/partners/[partnerId]/reject/route.ts`
- Sends rejection email with reason after partner is rejected
- Email failure doesn't block rejection process
- Fixed async params for Next.js 15 compatibility

#### Marketplace Purchase (Credit Payment)
**File**: `src/app/api/marketplace/purchase/route.ts`
- Sends purchase confirmation after successful credit purchase
- Includes download URL with 90-day expiration
- Gets user details for personalization

#### Stripe Webhook - Lead Purchase
**File**: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- Sends purchase confirmation after Stripe payment completes
- Retrieves user and purchase details from database
- Includes download URL with 90-day expiration
- Wrapped in try/catch to prevent webhook failures

#### Stripe Webhook - Credit Purchase
**File**: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- Sends credit confirmation after Stripe payment completes
- Shows new credit balance
- Includes package details and marketplace link
- Wrapped in try/catch to prevent webhook failures

### 4. ✅ Inngest Functions Wired Up

#### Partner Payout Completion
**File**: `src/inngest/functions/partner-payouts.ts`
- Sends payout notification after successful Stripe transfer
- Includes payout amount, period, and lead count
- Email failure doesn't block payout processing
- Calculates week start/end for period display

### 5. ✅ Environment Variables Documented
**File**: `.env.example`

Updated email service configuration:
```bash
# Email Services (REQUIRED for email notifications)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=Cursive <notifications@meetcursive.com>
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@meetcursive.com
```

Also required (already documented):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - For generating links in emails
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For webhook verification
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For database access

### 6. ✅ Next.js 15 Compatibility
Fixed async params in dynamic routes:
- `/api/admin/partners/[partnerId]/approve/route.ts`
- `/api/admin/partners/[partnerId]/reject/route.ts`
- `/api/marketplace/download/[purchaseId]/route.ts`

Changed from:
```typescript
{ params }: { params: { partnerId: string } }
```

To:
```typescript
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ partnerId: string }> }
const { partnerId } = await params
```

### 7. ✅ Idempotency Table Verified
**Table**: `processed_webhook_events`

Confirmed existing usage in Stripe webhook:
- Prevents duplicate webhook processing
- Stores: `stripe_event_id`, `event_type`, `processed_at`
- Used before processing any Stripe event

## Design Decisions

### Email Error Handling
All email sending is wrapped in try/catch blocks:
```typescript
try {
  await sendEmailFunction(...)
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('[Context] Failed to send email:', emailError)
  // Don't fail the main operation if email fails
}
```

**Rationale**: Email failures should never break critical operations like approvals, purchases, or payouts.

### Template Styling
- **PartnerApproved**: Green success callout for API key
- **PartnerRejected**: Yellow warning callout for reason
- **PurchaseConfirmation**: Blue info callout for download expiry
- **PayoutCompleted**: Large green box for payout amount
- **CreditPurchase**: Blue box for new balance

### URL Construction
All URLs use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`:
- Dashboard: `/partner`, `/partner/payouts`
- Downloads: `/api/marketplace/download/[id]`
- Marketplace: `/marketplace`
