- Enrichment post (46) → `/audience-builder` (data capabilities)

**Tier 2: Related Blog Links (Lateral)**

Each post includes **2-3 related blog links**:
- Post 19 → Post 30 (CRM workflows), Post 33 (CRM operations)
- Post 24 → Post 27 (privacy safeguards)
- Post 30 → Post 19 (CRM integration), Post 33 (operational impact)
