CRITICAL Guidelines:
- Be hyper-specific. Extract real examples, actual numbers, named features
- Avoid generic marketing speak. If you say "innovative" explain exactly how
- Focus on customer outcomes and transformations, not just features
- Identify emotional AND practical benefits for every value prop
- Brand voice should be descriptive enough to write in their style
- Messaging framework should be templates that can generate 100s of variations
- Extract their actual language patterns (do they say "customers" or "users"? "platform" or "tool"?)
- Look for repeated phrases, positioning statements, and key differentiators they emphasize`
