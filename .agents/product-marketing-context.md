✅ "When you can see who's visiting your site, you stop guessing and start converting"

#### 5. Honest Over Hype
We don't exaggerate. We don't make unrealistic promises. We're confident because we're good, not because we're loud.

❌ "The #1 revolutionary AI-powered game-changing platform"
✅ "The AI-powered platform that identifies 70% of your anonymous website visitors"

1. **What is it?** (clear product description)
2. **How does it work?** (simple explanation)
3. **Why does it matter?** (benefits, outcomes)
4. **Who is it for?** (target audience)
5. **What's different?** (vs. alternatives)
