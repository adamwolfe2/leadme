## Overview

### Purpose of This Document

This document provides **pre-approved anchor text variations** for all internal links on the Cursive marketing site. Use these recommendations to:

- Ensure SEO-optimized, keyword-rich anchor text
- Maintain natural, varied language (avoid over-optimization)
- Speed up content creation (no need to brainstorm from scratch)
- Maintain brand voice consistency

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Identify your link destination** (e.g., /visitor-identification)
2. **Find that section** in this document
3. **Choose an anchor text variation** you haven't used recently
4. **Integrate naturally** into your sentence
5. **Track usage** to ensure diversity

### Variation Importance

**Never use the same anchor text repeatedly for links to the same page.**

✅ **Good** (varied anchors to /visitor-identification):
- Post 1: "visitor identification platform"
- Post 2: "Cursive's visitor tracking solution"
- Post 3: "how visitor identification works"

❌ **Bad** (same anchor repeated):
- Post 1: "visitor identification platform"
- Post 2: "visitor identification platform"
- Post 3: "visitor identification platform"

## Anchor Text Principles

### The 3 C's of Great Anchor Text

**1. Clear**
The anchor text clearly describes what the user will find when they click.

✅ "behavioral audience segmentation strategies"
❌ "click here for more"

**2. Contextual**
The anchor text fits naturally into the sentence flow.

✅ "Cursive's [visitor identification platform] reveals anonymous traffic..."
❌ "Cursive has a platform. [Visitor identification platform click here]."

**3. Concise**
The anchor text is brief but descriptive (2-6 words ideal).

✅ "direct mail automation" (3 words)
❌ "comprehensive guide to direct mail automation strategies for B2B marketers" (11 words)

### Natural Language Formula

**Pattern**: [Action/Descriptor] + [Product/Topic] + [Benefit/Function]

**Examples**:
- [Cursive's] [visitor identification] [platform]
- [automated] [direct mail] [campaigns]
- [real-time] [data] [enrichment]
- [behavioral] [audience] [segmentation]

### Keyword Integration

Each anchor text should include:
- **Primary keyword** (the main search term)
- **Supporting modifiers** (brand name, descriptive adjectives)
- **Natural language** (flows in a sentence)

**Example for /visitor-identification**:
- Primary keyword: "visitor identification"
- Modifiers: "platform", "solution", "technology", "Cursive's"
- Natural: "Cursive's visitor identification platform"

## Usage Guidelines

### Anchor Text Selection Process

**Step 1: Identify Link Purpose**

Ask yourself:
- Is this introducing Cursive as a solution? → Use primary anchor with "Cursive"
- Is this a lateral link between related blogs? → Use topic-specific anchor
- Is this a CTA to convert? → Use action-oriented anchor
- Is this a technical deep-dive link? → Use specific feature anchor

**Step 2: Check Recent Usage**

Before selecting anchor text:
- Review last 3 blog posts for anchors used to this destination
- Choose a different variation (maintain diversity)
- Track usage in a simple spreadsheet if needed

**Step 3: Ensure Natural Fit**

Read your sentence aloud:
- Does the anchor text flow naturally?
- Is it clear what the user will find?
- Is it grammatically correct within the sentence?

**Step 4: Verify Keyword Inclusion**

Check that anchor includes:
- Primary target keyword for destination page
- Natural modifiers (don't force exact-match if awkward)
- Brand name (Cursive) in ~40% of links

### Anchor Text Diversity Formula

**For each destination page, rotate through anchor types**:

**Post 1**: Primary anchor + brand
→ "Cursive's visitor identification platform"

**Post 2**: Action-oriented anchor
→ "identify anonymous website visitors"

**Post 3**: Feature-specific anchor
→ "70% visitor identification rate"

**Post 4**: Benefit-oriented anchor
→ "turn anonymous visits into qualified leads"

**Post 5**: Secondary anchor
→ "visitor tracking and identification"

**Repeat cycle with variations.**

### Brand Name Inclusion

**When to Include "Cursive"**:
- First mention of a product/feature in content
- Links from high-authority pages (homepage, popular blogs)
- When differentiating from competitors
- In CTAs where brand association helps

**When to Omit "Cursive"**:
- Subsequent mentions in same piece
- Generic topic/category links
- When focusing on benefit over brand
- In natural sentence flow where it's awkward

**Target**: ~40% of internal links include "Cursive"

### Length Guidelines

**Ideal Length**: 3-5 words

**Too Short** (<2 words):
- "click here" ❌
- "visitor ID" (acceptable for casual mentions)

**Ideal** (3-5 words):
- "visitor identification platform" ✅
- "Cursive's audience builder" ✅
- "automated direct mail campaigns" ✅

**Too Long** (>8 words):
- "comprehensive guide to website visitor identification strategies for B2B companies" ❌

**Exception**: Stats can be longer if compelling:
- "identify 70% of anonymous website visitors" (6 words but impactful)

## Anchor Text Audit Checklist

### Before Publishing Content

Review all internal links and verify:

**Clarity**:
- [ ] Anchor text clearly describes destination
- [ ] No generic "click here" or "read more"
- [ ] Makes sense when read out of context

**Keyword Optimization**:
- [ ] Includes primary target keyword for destination
- [ ] Natural keyword integration (not forced)
- [ ] Uses varied keywords (not all exact-match)

**Diversity**:
- [ ] Not using same anchor text as recent posts to this destination
- [ ] Rotating through anchor text types (primary, action, benefit, feature)
- [ ] Includes brand name (Cursive) in appropriate links

**Natural Language**:
- [ ] Flows naturally in sentence
- [ ] Grammatically correct
- [ ] Appropriate length (3-5 words ideal)
- [ ] Not awkward or forced

**Brand Consistency**:
- [ ] Capitalized "Cursive" when used
- [ ] Uses official product names (Audience Builder, not "audience tool")
- [ ] Matches brand voice (professional but approachable)

### Monthly Anchor Text Audit

**Run this check monthly**:

1. **Over-Optimization Check**:
   - [ ] No single anchor text used >30% of the time for one destination
   - [ ] Varied anchor text across all links to each page
   - [ ] Mix of exact-match, partial-match, and branded anchors

2. **Under-Optimization Check**:
   - [ ] All anchors include relevant keywords
   - [ ] Not using too many generic anchors
   - [ ] Keywords align with target page's primary topic

3. **Quality Check**:
   - [ ] All anchors are descriptive and clear
   - [ ] No misleading anchors (promise one thing, link to another)
   - [ ] Natural language maintained throughout

4. **Diversity Scoring**:
   - For each major destination (solution hubs), calculate:
   - Total unique anchor texts / Total links = Diversity Score
   - **Target**: 0.7+ (70% unique anchors)
   - **Example**: 10 links with 7 unique anchors = 0.7 ✅

## Appendix: Anchor Text Tracking Template

### Simple Tracking Spreadsheet

Use this format to track anchor text usage:

| Destination URL | Anchor Text Used | Source Post | Date Used |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| /visitor-identification | visitor identification platform | Blog Post 22 | 2026-02-10 |
| /visitor-identification | Cursive's visitor tracking solution | Blog Post 25 | 2026-02-11 |
| /visitor-identification | identify anonymous visitors | Blog Post 01 | 2026-02-12 |
| /audience-builder | audience builder platform | Blog Post 02 | 2026-02-10 |
| /audience-builder | build targeted audiences | Blog Post 32 | 2026-02-11 |

**Why Track?**
- Ensure diversity (spot if you're overusing one anchor)
- Maintain quality (see what's working)
- Plan future content (know which anchors are "fresh")

**Review Monthly**: Check for over-used anchors, refresh with new variations.
