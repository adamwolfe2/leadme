# Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Guidelines

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-04

This document provides guidelines for optimizing content for answer engines, AI systems, voice search, and featured snippets. Use these patterns to ensure Cursive content is discoverable, citable, and preferred by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and traditional search engines.

---

## Why AEO Matters

Over 60% of Google searches now end without a click—users get their answers directly from featured snippets, AI Overviews, and answer boxes. AI assistants increasingly cite web content as sources. AEO ensures our content appears in these high-visibility positions.

**AEO optimizes for**:
- Featured snippets (position zero in search results)
- AI Overviews (Google's AI-generated answers)
- Voice search results (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- AI assistant citations (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
- "People Also Ask" boxes
- Knowledge panels

---

## Core AEO Principles

### 1. Answer Questions Directly

AI systems prefer content that answers questions clearly and immediately.

**Do this**:
```markdown
## What is visitor identification?

Visitor identification reveals the companies and individuals browsing your website—even if they don't fill out a form. It uses IP intelligence, device fingerprinting, and data matching to identify anonymous visitors in real-time.
```

**Not this**:
```markdown
## Understanding the Complex Landscape of Modern Visitor Identification

In today's digital ecosystem, many businesses struggle with understanding their website traffic...
```

**Pattern**: Place the direct answer in the first 1-2 sentences immediately after the question heading.

### 2. Use Question-Based Headings

Structure content around the exact questions people ask. Use natural language, not keyword-stuffed variations.

**Good question headings**:
- "What is visitor identification?"
- "How does Cursive identify anonymous website visitors?"
- "How much does visitor identification cost?"
- "What's the difference between hot and warm intent audiences?"
- "Can I use Cursive if I have low website traffic?"

**Bad question headings**:
- "Visitor Identification Explained"
- "Pricing Information"
- "Intent Audience Differences"
- "Low Traffic Solutions"

**Why**: AI systems match questions to questions. When someone asks "What is visitor identification?", content with that exact heading has higher citation probability.

### 3. Structure for Scannability

AI systems extract structured content more easily. Use:

- **Clear heading hierarchy** (H2 for main questions, H3 for follow-ups)
- **Bullet points** for lists and features
- **Tables** for comparisons
- **Bold text** for key terms and definitions
- **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences max)

### 4. Provide Self-Contained Answers

Each section should make sense independently. AI systems often extract individual sections without surrounding context.

**Self-contained**:
```markdown
### How long does Cursive implementation take?

Most teams are live within 24 hours. Install the Cursive pixel on your website (5 minutes), connect your integrations (10-15 minutes), and set up your first campaign. No developer required, though technical support is available.
```

**Not self-contained**:
```markdown
### Implementation Timeline

As mentioned earlier, the process is quick. Just install it and you're good to go in about a day.
```

### 5. Use Natural, Conversational Language

Voice search and AI assistants respond to conversational queries. Write how people speak, not how they type keywords.

**Conversational**:
- "How do I identify anonymous website visitors?"
- "What makes Cursive different from other visitor tracking tools?"
- "Can Cursive integrate with Salesforce?"

**Keyword-focused** (less AEO-friendly):
- "Anonymous website visitor identification process"
- "Cursive visitor tracking tool differences comparison"
- "Salesforce Cursive integration capability"

---

## Writing Question-Based Titles

Question-based titles improve click-through rates and AI citation rates.

### For Blog Posts

**Pattern**: [Question Word] + [Topic] + [Context/Qualifier]

**Examples**:
- "What is Visitor Identification and How Does It Work?"
- "How to Identify Anonymous Website Visitors in 2026"
- "Why Are 98% of Your Website Visitors Leaving Without Converting?"
- "Which B2B Lead Generation Strategy Works Best for SaaS Companies?"
- "When Should You Use Intent Data for Outbound Campaigns?"

### For Solution Pages

**Pattern**: How [Product/Feature] Helps You [Outcome]

**Examples**:
- "How Cursive Identifies 70% of Your Anonymous Website Traffic"
- "How AI Agents Handle Outbound Outreach While You Sleep"
- "How Intent Audiences Reduce Cost Per Qualified Lead by 40%"

### For Comparison Pages

**Pattern**: [Option A] vs [Option B]: [What You'll Learn/Decide]

**Examples**:
- "Cursive vs Traditional Visitor Tracking: Which Is Right for You?"
- "Hot vs Warm vs Scale Intent Audiences: How to Choose"
- "Visitor Identification vs Data Enrichment: What's the Difference?"

### Question Types That Work

1. **What** - Definitions and explanations ("What is visitor identification?")
2. **How** - Processes and tutorials ("How does visitor identification work?")
3. **Why** - Reasoning and benefits ("Why do B2B companies need visitor identification?")
4. **When** - Timing and triggers ("When should you use intent data?")
5. **Which** - Comparisons and choices ("Which intent audience is best for my campaign?")
6. **Who** - Audience and personas ("Who needs visitor identification?")
7. **Where** - Location and placement ("Where does visitor identification data come from?")

---

## Structuring FAQ Sections

FAQ sections are AEO gold. They target "People Also Ask" queries and FAQ schema.

### FAQ Best Practices

1. **Use real questions** from customer conversations, sales calls, and support tickets
2. **Match exact phrasing** people use when searching
3. **Answer directly** in the first sentence
4. **Keep answers concise** (50-100 words)
5. **Link to detailed content** if the topic deserves a full article
6. **Group related questions** under subtopics if you have 10+ FAQs

### FAQ Structure Template

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### [Exact question as users ask it]?

[Direct answer in first sentence]. [Supporting context in 2-3 additional sentences]. [Optional: Link to related resource].

### [Next question]?

[Direct answer]. [Supporting context].
```

### FAQ Examples

```markdown

## Natural Language Optimization

### Write for How People Speak

Voice search queries are longer and more conversational than typed searches.

**Typed search**: "visitor identification B2B"
**Voice search**: "How can I identify anonymous visitors on my B2B website?"

**Optimize for voice by**:
- Using complete sentences in headings
- Including question words (what, how, why, when)
- Answering in 30 words or less for voice results
- Using first-person and second-person pronouns ("you," "your," "I")

### Conversational Content Patterns

**Pattern 1: Question + Direct Answer**
```markdown
### Can I use Cursive if I have low website traffic?

Yes. Even with modest traffic, Cursive helps you maximize the value of every visitor. For lower-traffic sites, start with our pre-built Intent Audiences to access qualified prospects beyond your website visitors.
```

**Pattern 2: Natural Follow-Up**
```markdown
### What happens after I install the Cursive pixel?

Once installed, Cursive begins identifying visitors immediately. Within minutes, you'll see company names, contact details, and page views appearing in your dashboard. Most teams see their first identified visitor within the first hour.
```

### Answer Length Guidelines

- **Featured snippet answers**: 40-60 words
- **Voice search answers**: 20-30 words (aim for under 30)
- **FAQ answers**: 50-100 words
- **Full paragraph answers**: 100-150 words with supporting details

---

## Featured Snippet Targeting

Featured snippets appear above organic results in position zero. They drive significant traffic and AI citations.

### Types of Featured Snippets

1. **Paragraph snippets** - Direct answer in 40-60 words
2. **List snippets** - Numbered or bulleted lists
3. **Table snippets** - Comparison tables
4. **Video snippets** - Video results (usually YouTube)

### How to Target Paragraph Snippets

**Pattern**:
```markdown
## [Question as H2]

[Direct, concise answer in 40-60 words immediately after heading. Include key terms and specifics.]

[Expand with supporting details, examples, and context in following paragraphs.]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
## What is the difference between hot and warm intent audiences?

Hot intent audiences include users showing purchase signals within the last 7 days, offering highest conversion rates but smaller size. Warm intent audiences include users showing intent within the last 14 days, balancing conversion and scale. Both are updated weekly with fresh users showing active purchase intent.

### When to Use Hot Intent Audiences

Hot audiences work best for high-value offers with limited inventory...

### When to Use Warm Intent Audiences

Warm audiences provide more volume for scaling campaigns...
```

### How to Target List Snippets

**For numbered lists** (processes, steps, rankings):
```markdown
## How to Set Up Visitor Identification in Cursive

1. **Install the tracking pixel**: Add the Cursive code snippet to your website header (5 minutes)
2. **Connect your integrations**: Link your CRM and marketing tools through OAuth (10-15 minutes)
3. **Configure identification settings**: Choose what visitor data to capture and where to send it
4. **Test the integration**: Visit your own site to verify identification is working
5. **Launch and monitor**: Begin identifying visitors and review the dashboard daily
```

**For bulleted lists** (features, benefits, items):
```markdown
## Key Features of Cursive Visitor Identification

- **70% identification rate** for B2B website traffic
- **Real-time enrichment** with company and contact data
- **Page-level tracking** showing exactly what each visitor viewed
- **Return visitor detection** across multiple sessions
- **Engagement scoring** based on behavioral signals
- **CRM integration** automatically syncing identified visitors
```

### How to Target Table Snippets

**Comparison tables** often earn featured snippets:

```markdown
## Cursive vs Traditional Visitor Tracking Tools

| Feature | Cursive | Traditional Tools |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Identification Speed | Real-time | Batch (24-48 hours) |
| Accuracy Rate | Up to 70% | 40-50% |
| Data Activation | Built-in multi-channel | Manual export only |
| AI Automation | Yes (AI agents) | No |
| Integration Count | 200+ native | Limited (mostly Zapier) |
| Best For | B2B lead generation | Basic analytics |
```

### Featured Snippet Checklist

Before publishing content targeting featured snippets:

- [ ] Question in H2 heading matches search query exactly
- [ ] Direct answer in first 40-60 words after heading
- [ ] Answer is self-contained (makes sense without context)
- [ ] Supporting details expand on the answer
- [ ] Content uses proper formatting (bullets, numbers, tables)
- [ ] No fluff or filler in the direct answer
- [ ] Includes specific numbers, examples, or data points

**Example** - If targeting "visitor identification":

PAA questions might include:
- "What is visitor identification?"
- "How does website visitor identification work?"
- "Is visitor identification legal?"

- Link to related content for deeper dives
- Update content when new PAA questions appear

---

## Voice Search Optimization

Voice search queries are conversational, question-based, and longer than typed searches.

### Voice Search Query Patterns

**Question-based**:
- "What is..."
- "How do I..."
- "Where can I find..."
- "Why does..."
- "When should I..."
- "Who is the best..."

**Local intent** (if applicable):
- "Near me"
- "In [city]"
- "Closest"

**Conversational modifiers**:
- "How can I..."
- "What's the best way to..."
- "Tell me about..."
- "I need to..."

### Optimizing for Voice Results

**Voice answers are typically**:
- 20-30 words long
- Extracted from featured snippets
- Conversational in tone
- Direct and specific

**Example optimization**:

**Question**: "How can I identify anonymous website visitors?"

**Voice-optimized answer**:
```markdown
## How Can I Identify Anonymous Website Visitors?

Install a visitor identification tool like Cursive on your website to reveal up to 70% of anonymous traffic. The tool matches visitor data with company databases to identify who's browsing in real-time.
```

**Why this works**:

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

GEO optimizes content for citation by AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini.

### What AI Systems Look For

1. **Clear attribution and sources** - Citable facts with clear origins
2. **Specific statistics** - Numbers, percentages, timeframes
3. **Expert credentials** - Author expertise and authority
4. **Structured content** - Easy to parse and extract
5. **Up-to-date information** - Recent publication dates
6. **Self-contained statements** - Quotable without context

### Statistic Citation Pattern

AI systems prefer statistics with clear sourcing:

```markdown
According to [Source/Study], [specific statistic with number and timeframe]. [Context for why this matters].
```

**Examples**:
- "According to Google's 2024 Core Web Vitals report, 70% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices."
- "Cursive identifies up to 70% of B2B website traffic in real-time, compared to the industry average of 40-50%."
- "Research from HubSpot shows that B2B companies using visitor identification see 3x more qualified demos."

### Expert Quote Pattern

```markdown
"[Direct quote]," says [Expert Name], [Title] at [Organization]. [Context or interpretation].
```

**Example**:
```markdown
"The future of B2B lead generation is identifying intent before prospects fill out forms," says Adam Wolfe, Founder of Cursive. This approach allows sales teams to reach out while prospects are actively researching, increasing conversion rates significantly.
```

### Authoritative Claim Pattern

```markdown
[Topic] is [specific claim]. [Evidence/Research] confirms that [supporting data]. This means [actionable implication].
```

**Example**:
```markdown
Anonymous website traffic is the biggest missed opportunity in B2B marketing. Studies show that 98% of website visitors leave without converting, and up to 70% can be identified with modern visitor identification technology. This means B2B companies are losing thousands of potential leads every month by not implementing visitor identification.
```

### Self-Contained Answer Blocks

Create quotable statements that AI can extract directly:

```markdown
**[Topic/Question]**: [Complete, standalone answer in 2-3 sentences. Include specific details, numbers, or examples.]
```

**Examples**:

```markdown
**Best time to reach out to identified visitors**: Contact identified visitors within 24 hours of their site visit for highest response rates. Cursive data shows that outreach within this window converts 3x better than waiting 48+ hours. Most companies automate this with AI agents to ensure immediate follow-up.
```

```markdown
**Visitor identification accuracy rate**: Modern visitor identification tools identify 40-70% of B2B website traffic, with top platforms like Cursive reaching 70% accuracy. B2C identification rates are lower (20-30%) due to privacy regulations and residential IP variability. Accuracy depends on traffic source, device type, and data freshness.
```

---

## Content Formatting for AI Citation

### Use Clear Heading Hierarchy

```markdown
# Main Page Title (H1)

## Primary Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

#### Minor Point (H4)
```

AI systems use heading structure to understand content organization.

### Bold Key Terms and Definitions

```markdown
**Visitor identification** is the process of revealing anonymous website visitors using IP intelligence and data matching.
```

### Use Bullet Points for Lists

```markdown
Cursive provides five core capabilities:

- Visitor identification (up to 70% of traffic)
- Audience building (220M+ profiles)
- Intent audiences (pre-built segments)
- Direct mail automation (behavioral triggers)
- AI Studio (automated outreach)
```

### Use Tables for Comparisons

```markdown
| Feature | Cursive | Competitors |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Identification Speed | Real-time | 24-48 hours |
| Accuracy | Up to 70% | 40-50% |
| AI Automation | Yes | No |
```
