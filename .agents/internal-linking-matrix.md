## Internal Linking Rules & Guidelines

### Linking Frequency Per Blog Post

**Minimum**: 5 internal links per post
**Maximum**: 10 internal links per post
**Recommended**: 6-8 internal links

**Breakdown**:
- 1 solution hub link (required)
- 2-3 related blog links (required)
- 1 bottom-funnel link (required)
- 1 integrations link (required)
- 1-2 additional contextual links (optional)

### Link Placement Rules

**First 500 Words**: Must include 1 solution hub link
**Mid-Post (500-1500 words)**: Include 2-3 related blog links + integrations link
**Conclusion (last 200 words)**: Include 1 bottom-funnel CTA link
**Throughout**: Additional contextual links where natural

### Anchor Text Best Practices

**DO**:
- Use keyword-rich, descriptive anchor text
- Vary anchor text (don't repeat the same phrase)
- Make anchor text natural within sentence flow
- Include target keywords when relevant
- Use question-based anchors when appropriate

**DON'T**:
- Use generic "click here" or "read more"
- Over-optimize with exact-match keywords repeatedly
- Use the same anchor text for every link to a page
- Make anchors too long (keep under 6 words)
- Use all caps or excessive punctuation

### Link Quality Hierarchy

**Priority Levels**:
- **High**: Solution hub links, primary related content, conversion CTAs
- **Medium**: Secondary related content, category pages, integrations
- **Low**: Tertiary content, supplementary resources, footer links

### Nofollow vs. Dofollow

All internal links should be **dofollow** (default).

**Exception**: Links in author bios, promotional banners, or user-generated content may be nofollow.

## Implementation Checklist

### For Each New Blog Post

- [ ] Identify primary solution hub (Tier 1)
- [ ] Identify blog category (Tier 2)
- [ ] Select 2-3 related blogs for lateral links
- [ ] Choose bottom-funnel CTA page (rotate: platform, pricing, demo)
- [ ] Include integrations mention with link
- [ ] Write natural, keyword-rich anchor text for each link
- [ ] Place solution hub link in first 500 words
- [ ] Place bottom-funnel link in conclusion
- [ ] Verify all links work (no 404s)
- [ ] Check total link count (5-10 links)
- [ ] Update this matrix with new post links

### For Solution Hub Pages

- [ ] Link to minimum 8 related blogs
- [ ] Use varied, descriptive anchor text
- [ ] Distribute links throughout page (not all in one section)

**Quarterly**:

## Tracking & Measurement

### Metrics to Monitor

- Internal link click-through rate (CTR)
- Pages per session (should increase)
- Average session duration (should increase)
- Bounce rate (should decrease)

**SEO Metrics**:

- Organic traffic to linked pages
- Crawl depth in Google Search Console
- Pages indexed (should be 100%)

**Conversion Metrics**:

- Pricing page visits from blogs
- Newsletter signups from internal links

### GA4 Tracking Setup

Track internal link clicks with custom events:

```javascript
gtag('event', 'internal_link_click', {
  'from_page': document.title,
  'to_page': linkHref,
  'anchor_text': linkText,
  'link_position': 'hero|mid|conclusion'
})
```
