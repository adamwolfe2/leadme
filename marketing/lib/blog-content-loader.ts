    title: 'The Complete Guide to Website Visitor Identification',
    description:
      'Learn how visitor identification works, why it matters for B2B companies, and how to identify up to 70% of your anonymous website traffic.',
    content: `
      <h2 id="what-is-visitor-identification">What is Visitor Identification?</h2>
      <p>Visitor identification is the process of revealing the companies and individuals browsing your website—even when they don't fill out a form. For B2B companies, this means you can see which businesses are researching your product, which pages they viewed, and when they visited.</p>

      <p>Unlike traditional analytics that show you "anonymous user" or a session ID, visitor identification connects that traffic to real companies and sometimes individual contacts. This transforms your website from a passive brochure into an active lead generation engine.</p>

      <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why Visitor Identification Matters</h2>
      <p>According to industry research, 98% of B2B website visitors leave without converting. That means if you're driving 10,000 visitors per month, only 200 are filling out forms. The other 9,800 remain completely anonymous.</p>

      <p>Visitor identification helps you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify which companies are actively researching your product</li>
        <li>See what content prospects engage with before reaching out</li>
        <li>Prioritize sales outreach based on page views and engagement</li>
        <li>Retarget anonymous visitors with relevant advertising</li>
        <li>Build more accurate attribution models</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-it-works">How Visitor Identification Works</h2>
      <p>Visitor identification combines multiple data sources and techniques:</p>

      <h3 id="ip-address-lookup">1. IP Address Lookup</h3>
      <p>Every website visitor has an IP address. By cross-referencing IP addresses with databases of business IP ranges, you can identify which companies are visiting your site. This method works best for larger companies with dedicated IP addresses.</p>

      <h3 id="reverse-dns">2. Reverse DNS Lookup</h3>
      <p>Domain Name System (DNS) records can reveal the organization associated with an IP address. This is particularly effective for companies that own their IP infrastructure.</p>

      <h3 id="behavioral-fingerprinting">3. Behavioral Fingerprinting</h3>
      <p>By tracking patterns like device type, browser, time zone, and browsing behavior, visitor identification platforms can create unique visitor profiles and match them against known databases.</p>

      <h3 id="data-enrichment">4. Data Enrichment</h3>
      <p>Once a company is identified, enrichment services append additional firmographic data like industry, company size, revenue, technologies used, and key contacts.</p>

      <h2 id="identification-accuracy">Identification Accuracy Rates</h2>
      <p>Not all traffic can be identified. Accuracy depends on several factors:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>B2B traffic</strong>: 60-70% identification rate (business IP addresses are easier to identify)</li>
        <li><strong>B2C traffic</strong>: 15-25% identification rate (residential IPs are harder to match)</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile traffic</strong>: Lower identification rates due to carrier IP pooling</li>
        <li><strong>VPN users</strong>: Cannot be reliably identified</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cursive achieves a 70% identification rate for B2B traffic—among the highest in the industry.</p>

      <h2 id="implementation">How to Implement Visitor Identification</h2>
      <p>Setting up visitor identification typically involves:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Install tracking pixel</strong>: Add a JavaScript snippet to your website (similar to Google Analytics)</li>
        <li><strong>Configure identification rules</strong>: Decide which pages to track and what data to capture</li>
        <li><strong>Connect your CRM</strong>: Sync identified companies to Salesforce, HubSpot, or your CRM</li>
        <li><strong>Set up alerts</strong>: Get notified when target accounts visit your site</li>
        <li><strong>Build workflows</strong>: Automatically route hot leads to sales or trigger follow-up campaigns</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases for Visitor Identification</h2>

      <h3 id="sales-prioritization">Sales Prioritization</h3>
      <p>Instead of cold calling from static lists, your sales team can focus on companies actively researching your product. If a target account visits your pricing page three times in one week, that's a strong signal they're in-market.</p>

      <h3 id="account-based-marketing">Account-Based Marketing (ABM)</h3>
      <p>Visitor identification is essential for ABM programs. You can track which target accounts are engaging with your content, personalize their website experience, and coordinate sales and marketing outreach.</p>

      <h3 id="lead-scoring">Lead Scoring Enhancement</h3>
      <p>Combine firmographic data (company size, industry, revenue) with behavioral data (pages viewed, time on site, return visits) to create more accurate lead scores.</p>

      <h3 id="retargeting">Retargeting Campaigns</h3>
      <p>Build custom audiences for LinkedIn, Google, or Facebook ads based on specific page visits. For example, retarget companies that viewed your pricing page but didn't request a demo.</p>

      <h2 id="privacy-compliance">Privacy and Compliance</h2>
      <p>Visitor identification must comply with privacy regulations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>GDPR (Europe)</strong>: Requires consent for tracking personal data</li>
        <li><strong>CCPA (California)</strong>: Allows opt-out of data sale and sharing</li>
        <li><strong>Company-level identification</strong>: Generally lower risk than individual tracking</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cursive is fully compliant with GDPR and CCPA, with built-in consent management and opt-out handling.</p>

      <h2 id="choosing-platform">Choosing a Visitor Identification Platform</h2>
      <p>When evaluating visitor identification tools, consider:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identification accuracy</strong>: What percentage of traffic can they identify?</li>
        <li><strong>Data freshness</strong>: Real-time identification or batch processing?</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations</strong>: Does it connect to your CRM, marketing automation, and ad platforms?</li>
        <li><strong>Enrichment data</strong>: What firmographic and contact data is included?</li>
        <li><strong>Activation capabilities</strong>: Can you act on the data (emails, ads, direct mail)?</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing model</strong>: Per visitor, per identified company, or flat fee?</li>
      </ul>

        question: 'How accurate is visitor identification?',
        answer:
          'For B2B traffic, visitor identification typically achieves 60-70% accuracy. Cursive identifies up to 70% of business visitors. The remaining 30% includes residential IPs, VPN users, and mobile carrier traffic that cannot be reliably matched to companies.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is visitor identification legal under GDPR?',
        answer:
          'Yes, when implemented correctly. Company-level identification (revealing which business visited) is generally lower risk than individual tracking. However, you must provide clear privacy policies, obtain consent where required, and honor opt-out requests. Cursive is fully GDPR-compliant with built-in consent management.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How much does visitor identification cost?',
        answer:
          'Pricing varies widely. Some platforms charge per identified visitor (pay-as-you-go), others use monthly subscription models based on traffic volume. Cursive offers flexible pricing starting at $299/month for small businesses, with custom enterprise plans for high-traffic sites.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can visitor identification identify individual people?',
        answer:
          'Visitor identification focuses primarily on company-level data (which business visited). Some platforms can identify individual contacts when they return to your site after previously filling out a form, or through email link tracking. However, identifying unknown individuals at scale raises privacy concerns and is less common.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does it take to implement?',
        answer:
          'Implementation is typically very fast. Adding the tracking pixel takes 5-10 minutes (similar to Google Analytics). Connecting your CRM and setting up workflows might take 1-2 hours. Most companies start seeing identified companies within 24 hours of installation.',
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between visitor identification and website analytics?",
        answer:
          'Traditional analytics (like Google Analytics) shows you aggregate metrics and anonymous user sessions. Visitor identification reveals which specific companies and sometimes which individuals are visiting. Think of it as adding a name tag to your anonymous traffic.',
