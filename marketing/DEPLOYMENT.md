## 🎯 Current Setup

**Product App:**
- Domain: `leads.meetcursive.com`
- Directory: `/src` (root of repo)
- Vercel Project: (existing)

**Marketing Site:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "Module not found"**
- Make sure Root Directory is set to `marketing` in Vercel
- Check that `next.config.ts` has `turbopack.root: __dirname`

**Fonts not loading**
- Great Vibes is loaded from Google Fonts
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `app/layout.tsx` imports fonts correctly

**Animations not working**
- Framer Motion requires client components
- Check that components using `motion` have `"use client"` at top
