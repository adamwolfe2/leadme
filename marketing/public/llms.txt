## Use Cases by Audience

### For B2B SaaS Companies

**Challenge**: High website traffic but low conversion rates. Most visitors remain anonymous and leave without converting.

**Solution**: Cursive identifies up to 70% of anonymous visitors, revealing which companies viewed your pricing page, feature pages, or comparison content. See exactly who's interested before they fill out a form.

**Outcome**: More qualified demos without increasing ad spend. Sales teams focus on warm prospects who are actively researching. Better conversion rates on existing traffic.

**Example use case**: A Series B SaaS company uses Cursive to identify companies viewing their pricing page 3+ times. Sales receives alerts with company details, browsing behavior, and contact information—enabling warm outreach within hours.

### For Digital Marketing Agencies

**Challenge**: Clients expect multi-channel campaigns, but manual data work doesn't scale. Hard to prove ROI on anonymous traffic.

**Solution**: White-label Cursive for clients to offer premium services like visitor identification, intent data, and direct mail. Automated data enrichment and campaign activation across all channels.

**Outcome**: Offer high-margin services (visitor ID, intent audiences, direct mail) without hiring more people. Improve client results and retention. Prove attribution across anonymous and known traffic.

**Example use case**: A 15-person agency adds $50K+ in monthly recurring revenue by offering visitor identification and automated direct mail to their B2B clients. Same team, 3x more clients managed.

### For Enterprise Sales Teams

**Challenge**: Long sales cycles make it hard to prioritize accounts. Sales reps waste time on cold outreach. No visibility into early buyer research behavior.

**Solution**: Cursive's intent data reveals which accounts are actively researching solutions. Get alerts when target accounts visit your website. Prioritize accounts showing buying signals.

**Outcome**: Shorter sales cycles by reaching out when prospects are in-market. Higher win rates from focusing on warm prospects. Better forecasting with intent-based lead scoring.

**Example use case**: An enterprise team uses Cursive to track when competitor customers visit their website and comparison pages. Sales receives real-time alerts and reaches out while the prospect is actively evaluating alternatives—closing deals 40% faster.

## Common Questions

### What is visitor identification and how does it work?

Visitor identification reveals the companies and individuals browsing your website—even if they don't fill out a form. Cursive uses a combination of IP intelligence, device fingerprinting, and proprietary data matching to identify up to 70% of B2B website traffic in real-time. You install a lightweight pixel on your site, and Cursive enriches anonymous visitors with company details, contact information, and behavioral data.

### How accurate is Cursive's visitor identification?

Cursive identifies up to 70% of B2B website traffic with company-level data. For individual identification, accuracy depends on available signals but typically ranges from 30-50% for B2B visitors. All data is verified against multiple sources and updated in real-time (not monthly snapshots like some competitors).

### What integrations does Cursive support?

Cursive offers 200+ native integrations with CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive), marketing automation tools (Marketo, Pardot, ActiveCampaign), ad platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads), and analytics tools (Google Analytics, Segment, Mixpanel). We also support custom integrations via API and webhook.

### How long does implementation take?

Most teams are live within 24 hours. Install the Cursive pixel on your website (5 minutes), connect your integrations (10-15 minutes), and set up your first campaign. No developer required, though technical support is available.

### Is Cursive GDPR and privacy compliant?

Yes. Cursive is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations. We provide opt-out mechanisms, respect Do Not Track signals, and maintain strict data handling policies. All data is collected with proper consent and used in accordance with privacy laws.

### How much does Cursive cost?

Cursive offers flexible pricing starting at $499/month for small businesses and scaling to $999/month for growing companies, with enterprise plans available for high-volume needs. Pricing varies based on features, traffic volume, and usage. Contact us for a customized quote: https://cal.com/adamwolfe/cursive-ai-audit

### What's the difference between hot, warm, and scale intent audiences?

Intent levels indicate how recently users showed purchase signals:
- **Hot (7-day)**: Users showing intent signals within the last 7 days—highest conversion rates, smaller audience size
- **Warm (14-day)**: Users showing intent within the last 14 days—balanced conversion and scale
- **Scale (30-day)**: Users showing intent within the last 30 days—larger audience for scaling campaigns

All intent audiences are updated weekly with fresh users.

### Can I use Cursive if I don't have a large website traffic?

Yes. Even if you have modest traffic, Cursive helps you maximize the value of every visitor. For lower-traffic sites, we recommend starting with our pre-built Intent Audiences rather than just visitor identification—this gives you access to qualified prospects beyond your website visitors.

### How do AI agents work in Cursive?

AI agents are trained on your brand voice using your best-performing emails and messaging. They autonomously handle outreach, follow-ups, objection handling, and meeting booking across email, LinkedIn, and SMS. You set campaign parameters (who to contact, when, which channels), and the AI operates 24/7—deciding when to follow up, how to respond to replies, and when to escalate to humans.

### What makes Cursive different from Retarget IQ or similar tools?

Unlike traditional visitor identification tools that process data in batches (taking days), Cursive identifies visitors in real-time. We also go beyond data delivery—our AI agents actively help you engage prospects across multiple channels. Most competitors just give you data; Cursive helps you convert it into pipeline. We're built for AI-first workflows, not legacy manual processes.

### Do I need technical expertise to use Cursive?

No. Cursive is designed for marketers and sales teams, not engineers. Install the pixel with a simple code snippet (like Google Analytics), connect your tools through OAuth, and launch campaigns through our visual interface. Developer support is available for advanced use cases, but most users never need it.

### Can I see Cursive in action before committing?

Yes. Book a personalized demo to see Cursive identify your website visitors in real-time, build custom audiences, and set up an AI-powered campaign. We'll walk through your specific use case and show exactly how Cursive fits your workflow: https://cal.com/adamwolfe/cursive-ai-audit
