## About Cursive

Cursive is an AI-powered lead generation and outbound automation platform built for B2B companies. We help businesses identify anonymous website visitors, enrich contact data with 220M+ consumer and 140M+ business profiles, and activate multi-channel campaigns with AI agents that run 24/7. Cursive was founded because existing lead data providers delivered outdated contacts, generic emails, and no personalization -- so we built verified data, AI-powered outreach, and done-for-you campaigns that actually work.
