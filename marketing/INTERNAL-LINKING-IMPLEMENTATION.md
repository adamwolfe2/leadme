## Phase 2: Blog Posts Internal Linking ⚡ UPDATED POSTS COMPLETE

### Implementation Pattern

Each blog post receives 5-7 contextual internal links:

**Link Distribution:**
- **1 solution hub link** - Primary topic (visitor-identification, audience-builder, direct-mail, intent-audiences, or integrations)
- **2-3 lateral blog links** - Related posts within same category
- **1 integrations mention** - Reference to platform integrations where relevant
- **1-2 CTA links** - Demo/pricing (already implemented in all posts)

**Link Placement Strategy:**
- Place links naturally within body paragraphs
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link to solution hubs in early sections
- Link to related blogs in mid-content sections
- Ensure links add value and context for readers
