  {
    question: 'How is this different from other pixel tools claiming 60–80% match rates?',
    answer: 'Match rate claims are misleading without context. A 60% claimed match rate typically yields ~15% usable contacts after data decay. Our geo-framed, NCOA-verified methodology means the matches we deliver are real, verified contacts — not bulk IP grabs padded to inflate numbers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where does your data come from?',
    answer: 'We license directly from primary data providers and maintain our own proprietary identity graph. We are not a reseller. We do not buy derivatives. Our data is refreshed via NCOA every 30 days and email-verified at 10–15M records per day.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the bounce rate on your emails?",
    answer: '0.05% — verified against millions of records. Industry average for derivative-based data is 20%+.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I run V4 alongside V3?',
    answer: 'Yes. Both can run simultaneously on the same site.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get leads into my CRM?',
    answer: 'Via persistent API, native workflow integrations (GoHighLevel, Klaviyo), or custom HTTP endpoints. We have templates and a 17-minute walkthrough video covering every scenario.',
  },
  {
    question: "What if my leads don't convert immediately?",
    answer: "Intent level matters. Medium-intent leads require a nurture-first approach — run DSP exposure before calling. High-intent leads are ready for direct outreach. We'll help you match your approach to the intent level.",
