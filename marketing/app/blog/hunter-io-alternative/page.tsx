    question: "What is Hunter.io and what does it do?",
    answer: "Hunter.io is an email finding and verification tool used by freelancers, marketers, and sales teams to find professional email addresses. Given a domain name, Hunter searches its index of 200M+ email addresses to find the addresses associated with that company. It also offers a Chrome extension for finding emails directly from LinkedIn profiles, a bulk email verification service to check if email addresses are valid before sending, and a basic email drip campaign tool. Hunter is primarily used for building email lists for cold outreach and verifying existing lists to reduce bounce rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Hunter.io free? What are its limitations?",
    answer: "Hunter.io offers a free plan with 25 searches and 50 verifications per month -- enough for light testing but insufficient for active prospecting. Paid plans range from $49/month (500 searches) to $149/month (5,000 searches). The main limitations across all plans are: email addresses only (no phone numbers), no company data or firmographic enrichment, no visitor identification, no intent data, no AI outreach automation, and credit-based limits even on paid plans. For solo freelancers doing light outreach, the free tier is useful. For any sales team doing serious volume, the credit limits and email-only focus make Hunter a narrow tool."
  },
  {
    question: "What Hunter.io alternative includes phone numbers?",
    answer: "Cursive, Apollo.io, Lusha, and RocketReach all include phone numbers alongside email addresses. Lusha is specifically known for high-accuracy direct dial phone numbers from its LinkedIn Chrome extension workflow. Apollo includes phone numbers in its 200M+ contact database. RocketReach claims one of the highest phone accuracy rates with both mobile and office numbers. Cursive identifies website visitors and enriches them with both email and phone contact information from its 140M+ business profiles. Hunter.io does not include phone numbers in any plan -- if phone outreach is part of your strategy, Hunter is not the right tool."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best Hunter.io alternative with more automation?",
    answer: "Cursive is the top Hunter.io alternative if you want automation built in. While Hunter.io can send basic drip campaigns, it has no AI-powered sequencing, no behavioral triggers, no LinkedIn or SMS outreach, and no visitor identification to generate leads automatically. Cursive combines a lightweight website pixel that identifies up to 70% of your anonymous visitors, enriches them with 450B+ intent signals, and then deploys an AI SDR to send personalized outreach across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail -- all triggered automatically by visitor behavior. Snov.io is also worth considering if you want email finding plus automated drip campaigns at a lower price point."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Hunter.io identify website visitors?",
    answer: "No. Hunter.io has no website visitor identification capability. It is a lookup tool -- you provide a domain or name and it searches for the associated email address. If someone visits your website anonymously, Hunter cannot identify them. Cursive is the alternative that closes this gap with industry-leading 70% person-level visitor identification. Cursive installs a lightweight pixel on your website and in real time identifies which specific individuals are visiting -- not just which companies -- and enriches them with contact and intent data, triggering personalized outreach automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Hunter.io for B2B prospecting?",
    answer: "Hunter.io and Cursive serve very different use cases. Hunter.io is a lookup tool: you know a company you want to target, you search for their email addresses, and you reach out manually. Cursive is a pipeline generation platform: it identifies who is visiting your website (70% person-level match rate), enriches them with 450B+ behavioral intent signals across 30,000+ categories, and automatically deploys AI-personalized outreach across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail. Cursive's database includes 220M+ consumer profiles and 140M+ business profiles -- far beyond Hunter's email-address index -- and delivers outreach automation, CRM integration, and 95%+ deliverability in a single platform. Hunter is a useful utility for light email finding; Cursive is a complete outbound pipeline engine."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best free Hunter.io alternative?",
    answer: "Apollo.io has the most generous free tier of any full-featured B2B prospecting tool -- including 10,000 records and basic email sequencing at no cost. Lusha also offers a free tier with 50 monthly credits. Voila Norbert offers a pay-as-you-go model starting at $0.10 per verified email with no monthly fee, making it effectively free until you need volume. Hunter.io's own free plan (25 searches/month) is competitive for very light use, but Apollo's free tier delivers dramatically more value for sales teams doing serious prospecting work."

              <h2>Why Teams Look for Hunter.io Alternatives</h2>
              <p>
                Hunter.io earned its reputation as one of the most accessible email finding tools on the market.
                For freelancers, content marketers, and anyone doing light outreach, Hunter's ability to find
                professional email addresses from a company domain is genuinely useful. Its Chrome extension
                makes quick LinkedIn prospecting fast, and the bulk email verification service helps keep lists
                clean before sending.
              </p>

              <p>
                But for B2B sales teams with real pipeline targets, Hunter's limitations become apparent quickly.
                The tool was designed for individual use cases and has not evolved into a full B2B prospecting
                platform. Here is where teams consistently hit walls:

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">Best for: Email finding plus automated drip sequences in one affordable platform</p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Snov.io is the closest direct replacement for Hunter.io
                  in terms of email finding capability, but adds automated email drip sequences, a LinkedIn Chrome
                  extension, and email verification in a single platform at a competitive price. If you primarily
                  want what Hunter does -- find emails from domain names and LinkedIn -- but also want built-in
                  email automation, Snov.io is the natural Hunter-like upgrade. Its database of 200M+ email
                  addresses is comparable to Hunter's index.

                  last name plus company domain, and verifies them. What sets it apart from Hunter is its
                  pay-as-you-go pricing model -- starting at $0.10 per verified email with no monthly subscription
                  required. For freelancers and occasional prospectors who do not want a monthly Hunter commitment,
                  Voila Norbert's per-email pricing is the most flexible option.

                  makes it an excellent complement to inbound marketing workflows: enrich form fills with company

                  on firmographic fit. Not a cold outreach tool, but a powerful enrichment layer.

              {/* Decision Guide */}
              <h2>How to Choose the Right Hunter.io Alternative</h2>

              <p>
                The best Hunter.io alternative depends on what you need beyond simple email finding. Here is a
                framework based on the most common reasons teams outgrow Hunter:
              </p>

              <h3>If You Need a Full-Stack Pipeline Engine:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong><Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link></strong>.
                Cursive identifies the people visiting your website at{" "}
                <Link href="/visitor-identification" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">70% person-level match rate</Link>,
                enriches them with phone, email, LinkedIn, and 450B+ intent signals, and automates personalized
                multi-channel outreach -- all from a single platform. It is not just an email finder; it is a
                complete pipeline generation system built for modern B2B teams.
              </p>

              <h3>If You Need Phone Numbers + Sequencing at Low Cost:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Apollo.io</strong>. With a 200M+ database including phone numbers, a built-in
                email sequencer, and a free tier, Apollo is the most complete value upgrade from Hunter.io for
                teams doing serious outbound on a budget. Paid plans start at $49/user/month.
              </p>

              <h3>If You Need Direct Dial Phone Numbers for Cold Calling:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Lusha</strong> for accurate direct dial numbers from a LinkedIn-driven workflow
                at $29/user/month. Lusha is the fastest upgrade from Hunter for teams that cold call as well
                as email and need accurate mobile numbers.
              </p>

              <h3>If You Want Something Similar to Hunter But with Email Automation:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Snov.io</strong> for an email finder with built-in drip campaign automation.
                It is the closest functional equivalent to Hunter.io with an outreach layer added, at competitive
                pricing starting from $39/month.
              </p>

              <h3>If You Need Pay-As-You-Go with No Monthly Commitment:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Voila Norbert</strong> at $0.10 per verified email with no subscription. Ideal
                for freelancers or occasional prospectors who find Hunter's monthly tiers wasteful for their
                irregular usage patterns.
              </p>

              <h3>If You Need the Largest Possible Contact Database:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>RocketReach</strong> for a 700M+ profile database with both mobile and office
                phone numbers. Best for teams prospecting into non-traditional industries or needing the widest
                possible contact coverage.
              </p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600">Hunter.io is email-only. If you cold call at all, you need Apollo, Lusha, RocketReach, or Cursive -- all of which include phone data alongside emails.</p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600">Hunter's built-in campaigns are rudimentary. For AI-personalized multi-channel outreach (email + LinkedIn + SMS), Cursive is the leader. For basic email sequences, Apollo or Snov.io are solid choices.</p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600">Hunter's credits run out fast at scale. Apollo's 200M+ database and monthly plans, or Cursive's per-lead self-serve model, are better suited for teams prospecting hundreds of contacts per month.</p>

              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                Hunter.io is a useful, low-friction tool for exactly what it was designed to do: find email
                addresses associated with a company domain. For freelancers, content marketers, and small teams
                doing light outreach, it remains a practical utility. But it was not designed to be a B2B sales
                tool, and it shows.
              </p>

              <p>
                The limitations are fundamental, not superficial: no phone numbers, no visitor identification,
                no intent data, credit limits at every price tier, and minimal automation. As outbound sales
                has evolved to require multi-channel, personalized, intent-driven engagement at scale, Hunter.io
                has not kept pace.
              </p>

              <p>
                For most B2B sales teams in 2026, the right upgrade path is clear: Apollo.io if you want a full
                prospecting database + sequencing at an accessible price; Lusha if direct dial phone accuracy
                is the priority; Snov.io if you want Hunter-like simplicity with drip campaigns added; RocketReach
                if you need maximum contact coverage including phones; and Cursive if you want to stop prospecting
                cold entirely and instead convert the high-intent buyers already visiting your website -- with
                AI-powered outreach included in the same platform.
              </p>

              <p>
                For teams ready to make the leap from email finding to pipeline generation,{" "}
                <Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link> represents the most
                significant evolution: a platform that does not just help you find people to contact, but identifies
                the people who have already raised their hand by visiting your website, and converts them
                automatically.
              </p>

              <h2>About the Author</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Adam Wolfe</strong> is the founder of Cursive. After working with hundreds of B2B teams
                that started with Hunter.io and needed a more complete pipeline solution, he built Cursive to
                address the fundamental gap all email finders share: they tell you who to contact, but not who
                is already interested.
