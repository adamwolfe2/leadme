    question: "What is Overloop and what does it do?",
    answer: "Overloop (formerly Prospect.io) is a sales automation and cold email platform that helps sales teams run multi-channel outreach sequences. It combines email sequences, LinkedIn automation, and a built-in CRM to manage contacts and deals. Overloop is designed for outbound sales teams that want to reach cold prospects through structured cadences across email and LinkedIn simultaneously."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are teams looking for Overloop alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons teams move away from Overloop include: per-user pricing that gets expensive fast ($99-$149/user/month for a small team quickly exceeds $1,000/mo), no website visitor identification so you are always working cold contact lists, no AI-generated personalization (sequences are templated not truly personalized), no intent data to help prioritize who to contact first, and limited data enrichment that forces reliance on third-party data tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Overloop for outbound?",
    answer: "Cursive takes a fundamentally different approach than Overloop. While Overloop starts with cold contact lists and runs templated sequences, Cursive identifies people who have already visited your website — warm leads who have shown real buying intent. Cursive then uses AI to write personalized emails based on the visitor's company, role, and behavior, and delivers outreach via email, LinkedIn, and direct mail. At $1,000/month flat (not per-user), Cursive typically costs less than Overloop for teams of two or more people while generating significantly better reply rates from warm, intent-driven outreach."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Cursive have LinkedIn automation like Overloop?",
    answer: "Yes. Cursive includes multi-channel outreach that covers LinkedIn alongside email and direct mail. Where Overloop's LinkedIn automation is a bolt-on to its core email sequences, Cursive's multi-channel approach is built around intent signals — your AI SDR automatically decides the right channel mix based on visitor behavior and firmographic data. This means LinkedIn touches in Cursive are triggered by real buying signals, not just a cadence timer."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Cursive better than Overloop for small teams?",
    answer: "For small B2B sales teams, Cursive often delivers better ROI than Overloop. Overloop's per-seat pricing means two reps cost $200-300/month before you add data costs. Cursive's $1,000/month flat rate covers your entire team with visitor identification, AI-written personalized outreach, intent data, and multi-channel sequences included. More importantly, Cursive works warm leads from your own website traffic rather than cold lists, which typically produces 3-5x higher reply rates — making every outreach dollar go further for small teams."

                Overloop built its reputation as a multi-channel sales automation platform — combining email sequences,
                LinkedIn outreach, and a lightweight CRM in one place. For teams that want to run structured cold
                outreach at scale, it checks a lot of boxes. But as go-to-market teams mature, the gaps become
                harder to ignore.
              </p>

              <p>
                The core problem: Overloop starts with cold. You import a list, write a template, and blast it at
                people who have never heard of you. In 2026, cold outreach reply rates have fallen to 1-3% on a
                good day. Meanwhile, teams that focus on <Link href="/visitor-identification">website visitors who
                have already shown buying intent</Link> routinely see 10-20% reply rates. That difference compounds
                dramatically at scale.

              <p>
                Overloop is a capable tool, but five specific pain points drive teams to look for something different.
              </p>

                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 5 Pain Points with Overloop</h3>
                <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                    <span><strong>Per-seat pricing escalates fast:</strong> At $99–$149/user/month, a team of four reps
                    costs $400–$600/month before you add any data or enrichment tools. For most mid-market B2B
                    companies, the total stack cost rivals or exceeds more capable all-in-one platforms.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">

                    <span><strong>Always starting cold:</strong> Overloop is built around contact lists — you import
                    a CSV, write a sequence, and send to people who have never engaged with you. There is no mechanism
                    to identify or prioritize people who have already visited your website and shown real buying intent.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                    <span><strong>No AI personalization:</strong> Overloop sequences are template-based. You write the
                    email, merge in {"{first_name}"} and {"{company}"}, and send. True AI personalization — where each
                    email is uniquely written based on the recipient&apos;s company, role, recent news, and behavior —
                    requires additional tools or manual research.</span>

                    <span><strong>No intent data or visitor signals:</strong> Overloop has no way to tell you that a
                    prospect from your target account visited your pricing page twice this week. Without intent signals,
                    you cannot prioritize outreach to the hottest prospects — every contact in your sequence looks
                    the same regardless of buying readiness.</span>

                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                    <span><strong>Limited data enrichment:</strong> Overloop relies on you to bring your own contact
                    data. While it integrates with some data providers, it does not include deep enrichment capabilities
                    out of the box, meaning you need additional subscriptions to get the firmographic and contact data
                    your sequences need.</span>

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Instantly is built for scale — it lets you connect unlimited

                  strategy relies on high-volume cold email, Instantly&apos;s infrastructure is best-in-class. Unlike
                  Overloop, Instantly is laser-focused on email (no LinkedIn automation), but its deliverability features
                  — including automated warm-up and inbox rotation — keep emails landing in primary inboxes at scale.
                  The tradeoff: like Overloop, it starts cold with no visitor identification.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Salesloft is a full enterprise sales engagement platform
                  with deep Salesforce integration, call recording, conversation intelligence, and coaching features.
                  If Overloop feels too lightweight for your organization and you need enterprise-grade workflow
                  management, Salesloft steps up. It handles email sequences, call tasks, LinkedIn steps, and
                  meeting management — all connected to your CRM in real time. The tradeoff is price: Salesloft
                  costs $125+/user/month and requires significant setup.

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Outreach is a category-defining enterprise sales
                  orchestration platform with AI features that guide reps on next best actions, predict deal
                  outcomes, and surface coaching insights. Like Salesloft, it is a step up in complexity and cost
                  from Overloop. Outreach&apos;s AI Deal Insights and pipeline forecasting features make it
                  valuable for enterprise teams managing large deal counts. For teams that have outgrown Overloop&apos;s
                  simplicity but need more intelligence than Salesloft provides, Outreach is worth evaluating.

              <h2>Pricing Comparison: Overloop vs Alternatives</h2>

              <p>
                Overloop&apos;s per-seat pricing model is one of the biggest reasons teams explore alternatives. Here
                is how costs compare for a 3-person sales team.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Overloop (3 reps):</strong> $99–$149/user/month = $297–$447/mo for sequences only. Add a data
                provider ($100+/mo) and an enrichment tool ($100+/mo) and you are at $500–$650+/month for a fragmented
                cold outreach stack.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Cursive (whole team):</strong> $1,000/mo flat covers your entire team — no per-seat fees. Includes
                visitor identification, AI-written personalized outreach, intent data, and multi-channel delivery. The
                key difference: Cursive works warm inbound leads, not cold lists, so the revenue generated per dollar
                spent is typically much higher. Visit our <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link> for full details.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Budget cold email option:</strong> Instantly ($37/mo) + Apollo for data ($49/user/mo) gives you
                a functional cold outreach stack for 3 reps at around $186/mo. The tradeoff: still cold, no visitor ID,
                and your reply rates will be correspondingly low.
              </p>

              {/* Bottom Line */}
              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                Overloop is a decent multi-channel cold outreach platform, but it charges per-seat, starts cold, and
                has no path to warm lead conversion. For teams that have been running cold sequences and are frustrated
                with reply rates, the fundamental issue is not the tool — it is the approach.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you want to keep the cold outbound model and just want a cheaper or more scalable tool, Apollo is
                the best Overloop alternative. If you want higher reply rates and a fundamentally different approach,{" "}
