    question: "What is Qualified.com and what does it do?",
    answer: "Qualified.com is a website visitor routing and conversational marketing platform built primarily for Salesforce users. It uses live chat, AI chatbots, and meeting scheduling to convert website visitors into sales conversations in real time. Qualified identifies visiting companies using reverse IP lookup and routes them to the appropriate sales rep based on CRM data and account ownership. It is priced at $3,500-$7,500+/month and requires Salesforce as its CRM."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the fundamental difference between Qualified and Cursive?",
    answer: "The core difference is engagement requirement. Qualified only knows about visitors who choose to interact with its chat widget — they must click, type, and initiate a conversation. If a visitor views your pricing page three times and leaves without chatting, Qualified never captures them. Cursive identifies ALL visitors by name, email, job title, company, and LinkedIn profile regardless of whether they engage with anything on the page. You see every visitor, not just the 1-3% who choose to initiate chat."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Qualified's identification rate compare to Cursive?",
    answer: "Qualified relies on reverse IP lookup for company-level identification, which typically identifies 20-40% of visitors at the company level only — and only for companies with static IP addresses, which is increasingly rare as more traffic comes from mobile and VPN. Cursive uses a 280M-profile identity graph to identify up to 70% of visitors at the person level — returning their name, email, job title, company, and LinkedIn URL, not just the company name."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Qualified worth the price for non-Salesforce users?",
    answer: "No. Qualified is built specifically for Salesforce and requires it as the underlying CRM. If you are not on Salesforce, Qualified is not the right fit. Its routing logic, account ownership matching, and pipeline attribution are all deeply tied to Salesforce's data model. For non-Salesforce teams, Cursive is a stronger option — it integrates with 200+ CRM tools and does not require any specific underlying platform."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Cursive replace Qualified for B2B pipeline generation?",
    answer: "Yes, and in most cases Cursive provides broader coverage at lower cost. Qualified captures only visitors who engage with chat. Cursive identifies all anonymous visitors automatically, gives you their contact information, and can trigger immediate AI-powered outreach via email, LinkedIn, SMS, or direct mail. Instead of waiting for a visitor to chat, Cursive proactively surfaces them the moment they arrive and can reach out before the session ends."
  },
  {
    question: "What companies are best suited for Qualified vs Cursive?",
    answer: "Qualified is best for large Salesforce-dependent enterprise teams with high-value, named accounts and inside sales reps monitoring chat in real time. Cursive is better for B2B teams that want to identify and engage the full spectrum of website traffic — not just the small fraction who initiate chat. Cursive also works for teams not on Salesforce, those wanting automated outreach rather than live chat, and those where $3,500-$7,500/mo is a barrier."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Cursive have live chat like Qualified?",
    answer: "Cursive does not include a live chat widget. Its approach is different: rather than waiting for visitors to initiate conversation, Cursive automatically identifies visitors, enriches them with contact data, and triggers outreach through email, LinkedIn, SMS, or direct mail when intent signals fire. This covers the 97-99% of visitors who will never click a chat widget, which is the population Qualified cannot reach."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing compare between Qualified and Cursive?",
    answer: "Qualified starts at $3,500/month and scales to $7,500+/month depending on traffic volume and features. Cursive's managed plan is $1,000/month all-in, including visitor identification, intent data, AI SDR outreach, and 200+ CRM integrations. Cursive also offers a self-serve option at leads.meetcursive.com where you can purchase leads at $0.60 each with no monthly commitment. The price difference is significant: Qualified's entry plan costs 3.5x Cursive's managed plan."

                Qualified.com built a strong position in enterprise sales by promising to turn website visitors into
                pipeline through live chat, AI chatbots, and real-time routing. For Salesforce-dependent enterprise teams
                with inside sales reps monitoring chat queues, it delivers. But Qualified has a fundamental architectural
                limitation: it only captures visitors who choose to engage with its chat widget.
              </p>

              <p>
                In practice, that means Qualified sees somewhere between 1% and 5% of your website visitors. The other
                95-99% — people who read your pricing page, compare features, check case studies, and leave — are completely
                invisible to Qualified. Those silent visitors are often your highest-intent prospects, and Qualified has
                no way to identify them.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this guide, we compare six Qualified alternatives that approach visitor intelligence differently,
                including tools that identify visitors without requiring any engagement, at better ID rates and lower
                price points.

              {/* The Core Problem */}

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  Qualified identifies visitors in two ways:
                </p>
                <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm">
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-amber-600 font-bold mt-0.5">1.</span>
                    <span><strong>CRM matching:</strong> If a visitor arrives from an email link or is already a known contact in Salesforce, Qualified can surface their data. This covers only known contacts who click through from tracked communications.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-amber-600 font-bold mt-0.5">2.</span>
                    <span><strong>Reverse IP lookup:</strong> For anonymous visitors, Qualified uses reverse IP to guess the company. This works for about 20-30% of B2B traffic and returns only company name, not individual identity. It also fails for home workers, mobile visitors, and VPN users.</span>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">
                  The result: Qualified sees a fraction of your traffic at company level only, and only surfaces them
                  when they interact with the chat widget. The vast majority of your warm visitors leave unidentified.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Where Qualified waits for visitors to chat, <Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link> identifies
                  them the moment they arrive — regardless of whether they interact with anything. Cursive installs a lightweight
                  pixel that fires against its 280M US consumer and 140M+ business profile identity graph, matching anonymous
                  sessions to real people with names, email addresses, job titles, companies, and LinkedIn profiles. The
                  match rate is 70% person-level — compared to Qualified&apos;s 20-30% company-level reverse IP lookup.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Beyond identification, Cursive also includes an <Link href="/what-is-ai-sdr" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">AI SDR</Link> that
                  automatically triggers personalized outreach via email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail when visitors meet
                  your criteria. Instead of a sales rep monitoring Qualified&apos;s chat queue and hoping the right visitor
                  engages, Cursive proactively reaches out to every identified visitor at the right moment. Real-time
                  alerts also fire when target accounts visit, so your team can follow up immediately if preferred.

                  Warmly is the closest direct Qualified alternative in approach. It de-anonymizes website visitors using
                  reverse IP and identity partners, surfaces them in Slack with company-level data, and routes them to
                  the right sales rep based on account ownership in the CRM. Unlike Qualified, Warmly does not require
                  visitors to engage with a chat widget — it surfaces all company-level traffic. However, Warmly&apos;s
                  identification is company-level only (not person-level), at roughly 40% match rate, and at $3,500/mo
                  it matches Qualified&apos;s entry price without the person-level data Cursive provides.

                  RB2B (rb2b.com) took the visitor identification market by surprise with its free tier offering. It
                  identifies website visitors at the person level — returning LinkedIn profiles — and pushes those alerts
                  to Slack. At a 50-60% identification rate and with a free entry tier, it is an accessible way to start
                  person-level visitor intelligence. The limitations become apparent at scale: no outreach automation,
                  limited enrichment depth beyond LinkedIn profile, and the paid tiers start to compete with Cursive on
                  price while offering significantly less capability.

                Qualified is a well-built product for the problem it solves: routing the visitors who choose to engage
                with your chat widget to the right sales rep. But that is an increasingly small subset of your total
                website traffic.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2026, the most effective B2B teams are not waiting for visitors to raise their hand. They are
                identifying every anonymous visitor the moment they arrive, enriching them with full contact data,
                and triggering personalized outreach before the session ends. That is a fundamentally different workflow
                than what Qualified enables.
              </p>
