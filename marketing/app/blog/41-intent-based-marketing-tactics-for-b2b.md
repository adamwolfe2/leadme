# Intent-Based Marketing Tactics That Actually Convert B2B Leads

Most B2B marketing wastes effort on the wrong prospects at the wrong time. You send email campaigns to contacts who aren't researching solutions. You run ads targeting people who bought a competitor's product last year. You chase leads who visited your site once six months ago.

Intent-based marketing flips this approach. Instead of broadcasting messages to everyone and hoping something sticks, you identify prospects showing active buying signals and engage them with relevant content matched to their research stage.

When you know which companies visited your pricing page this week, downloaded competitor comparisons, and researched your integrations—you can reach out with messaging that feels helpful instead of interruptive. You stop chasing cold leads and start converting warm ones.

## What Makes Intent-Based Marketing Different

Traditional marketing targets people based on static attributes: job title, company size, industry. These demographics tell you who someone is, but not what they're doing right now.

Intent-based marketing focuses on behavior and timing:

- **Who is actively researching** solutions in your category
- **What content they're engaging with** on your site and across the web
- **When they're showing buying signals** like repeated visits or high-value page views
- **Where they are in their journey** from awareness to evaluation to decision

This shift from demographic targeting to behavioral targeting changes everything. You're not guessing who might need your product someday. You're identifying accounts that are shopping for solutions right now.

**The result:** Higher conversion rates, shorter sales cycles, and better ROI on every marketing dollar.

## Tactic 1: Prioritize Outreach Based on Real-Time Intent

The most effective intent-based tactic is simple: reach out to accounts showing strong buying signals before your competitors do.

Build a system that automatically surfaces high-intent accounts for your sales team:

### Set Intent Thresholds

Define what constitutes a "hot lead" based on specific behavioral combinations:

- Visited pricing page 2+ times in 7 days
- Downloaded product comparison guide or case study
- Researched integration documentation
- Viewed demo or trial signup page
- Returned to site 3+ times in 30 days

When accounts cross these thresholds, they should trigger immediate alerts to sales reps.

### Score and Rank by Intent + Fit

Not all high-intent accounts are equal. Someone showing strong buying signals but outside your ICP wastes time. Prioritize accounts that combine:

- **High firmographic fit**: Right industry, company size, and location
- **High behavioral intent**: Active research, repeat visits, engagement with bottom-funnel content

**[Cursive automatically scores and prioritizes accounts using 450 billion+ monthly intent signals](/intent-audiences)**, surfacing prospects who match your ICP and are actively evaluating solutions. Your sales team gets a clean list of warm leads, not a data dump. Learn about [tracking intent signals for B2B marketing](/blog/40-intent-signal-tracking-for-b2b-marketing).

### Personalize Outreach Based on Behavior

When you know what content someone engaged with, your outreach becomes relevant:

- They viewed case studies from healthcare companies? Lead with healthcare success stories.
- They researched your Salesforce integration? Mention how seamlessly you sync with their existing CRM.
- They downloaded a competitor comparison? Address key differentiators directly.

This level of personalization only works when you have visibility into prospect behavior. With [Cursive's visitor identification](/visitor-identification), you can identify up to 70% of anonymous website traffic and see exactly which pages they viewed—even before they fill out a form.

## Tactic 2: Build Segmented Nurture Campaigns by Intent Stage

Not everyone showing intent is ready to buy today. Some are just starting their research. Others are deep into vendor evaluation. Your messaging should match where they are in their journey.

Create segmented nurture tracks based on intent stage:

### Early-Stage Intent (Awareness)

**Signals**: Blog reads, educational content downloads, general product category research

**Messaging focus**: Educational content, industry insights, problem identification

**Channels**: Email nurture sequences, retargeting ads with thought leadership content, social media engagement

**Goal**: Build awareness and establish credibility as they begin researching solutions

### Mid-Stage Intent (Consideration)

**Signals**: Product page visits, feature comparisons, case study downloads, integration research

**Messaging focus**: Product capabilities, customer success stories, ROI frameworks, competitive differentiation

**Channels**: Targeted email sequences, retargeting ads highlighting key features, LinkedIn outreach from sales reps

**Goal**: Position your solution as the best fit for their specific use case

### High-Stage Intent (Decision)

**Signals**: Pricing page visits, demo requests, contract/security documentation downloads, repeated high-value page visits

**Messaging focus**: Pricing, implementation support, customer success programs, risk mitigation, urgency

**Channels**: Direct sales outreach, personalized email from AEs, retargeting with limited-time offers or success guarantees

**Goal**: Remove final objections and accelerate decision-making

Cursive's [audience builder](/audience-builder) lets you segment prospects by intent stage automatically, triggering the right campaigns based on real-time behavior. When someone moves from early research to active evaluation, they automatically enter the appropriate sequence—no manual list management required.

## Tactic 3: Deploy Retargeting Ads Based on Specific Intent Signals

Not everyone who visits your site is ready to convert immediately. Retargeting keeps you visible as they continue researching, but generic ads waste budget.

Intent-based retargeting shows different messaging to different audiences based on their behavior:

### Pricing Page Visitors

**Intent signal**: Viewed pricing but didn't request demo

**Retargeting message**: ROI calculators, customer testimonials, limited-time offers, "See it in action" demo invitations

**Goal**: Address pricing objections and move them toward a conversation

### Case Study Readers

**Intent signal**: Downloaded or viewed customer success stories

**Retargeting message**: Additional case studies from similar industries, "How it works" product videos, comparison guides

**Goal**: Reinforce proof points and build confidence in your solution

### Product Feature Researchers

**Intent signal**: Viewed specific feature pages or integration documentation

**Retargeting message**: Deep-dive content on those specific features, video demos, technical documentation

**Goal**: Answer detailed product questions and demonstrate capabilities

### Competitor Comparison Researchers

**Intent signal**: Viewed competitor comparison content or researched alternatives

**Retargeting message**: Head-to-head comparisons, switching guides, "Why customers choose us" content

**Goal**: Position your solution as the superior choice

With [Cursive's 200+ integrations](/integrations), intent signals automatically sync with your ad platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn), creating dynamic retargeting audiences that update in real time as prospect behavior changes.

## Tactic 4: Trigger Multi-Channel Sequences Based on Intent Patterns

Single-channel outreach rarely converts high-intent prospects. Multi-channel campaigns that coordinate email, ads, sales outreach, and even direct mail drive better results.

Build automated sequences triggered by intent patterns:

### High-Intent Trigger Sequence

**Trigger**: Account visits pricing page 3+ times in 7 days

**Automated actions**:
- Day 0: Sales rep receives alert with full activity timeline
- Day 0: Prospect enters retargeting campaign with ROI-focused ads
- Day 1: Personalized email from AE mentioning their specific research activity
- Day 3: LinkedIn connection request from sales rep
- Day 5: Follow-up email with case study from similar company
- Day 7: Direct mail piece with personalized demo invitation (optional for enterprise accounts)

### Re-Engagement Trigger Sequence

**Trigger**: Previously engaged account returns after 30+ days of inactivity

**Automated actions**:
- Day 0: Email highlighting new features or updates since their last visit
- Day 2: Retargeting ads featuring recent customer success stories
- Day 5: Sales outreach if they engage with any content
- Day 7: Offer for exclusive demo or consulting session

### Competitive Research Trigger Sequence

**Trigger**: Account researches competitor alternatives alongside your product

**Automated actions**:
- Day 0: Retargeting with competitive differentiation messaging
- Day 1: Email featuring comparison guide or switching resources
- Day 3: Sales outreach addressing common objections about competitors
- Day 5: Case study from customer who switched from competitor

Cursive's intent data feeds these sequences automatically, ensuring prospects receive relevant messaging based on their actual behavior—not arbitrary timelines.

## Tactic 5: Coordinate Sales and Marketing Around Intent Signals

The biggest intent-based marketing failure happens when sales and marketing don't share data. Marketing sees website behavior. Sales sees CRM activity. Neither team has the full picture.

Fix this by centralizing intent signals in your CRM:

### Real-Time Intent Alerts for Sales

When high-intent accounts appear, sales needs to know immediately—not in next week's report. Set up alerts that notify reps when:

- Target accounts visit high-value pages
- Existing leads return after extended dormancy
- Multiple contacts from the same company engage simultaneously
- Accounts match both ICP criteria and behavioral intent thresholds

### Shared Intent Dashboards

Create dashboards accessible to both sales and marketing showing:

- Top intent accounts by score
- Recent high-intent activities
- Campaign engagement overlaid with website behavior
- Pipeline influence from intent sources

### Intent-Qualified Lead Handoffs

Establish clear criteria for when marketing hands intent-qualified leads to sales. Not every intent signal requires sales outreach, but strong combinations should trigger immediate follow-up.

Example handoff criteria:
- Firmographic fit score > 80
- Intent score > 70
- Visited pricing page 2+ times in 7 days
- Downloaded bottom-funnel content

**Cursive syncs intent data directly into your CRM via 200+ native integrations**, ensuring sales reps see complete activity timelines without switching tools. Marketing and sales work from the same data, eliminating handoff friction. See [why CRM integration is crucial for smooth operations](/blog/33-why-crm-integration-is-crucial-for-smooth-operations).

## Tactic 6: Use Intent Data to Optimize Campaign Targeting

Intent signals don't just improve outreach timing—they also reveal which audiences convert best and which channels drive the highest intent.

Mine your intent data to optimize campaigns:

### Identify High-Intent Content

Which content assets generate the strongest buying signals? Track:

- Which blog posts or resources precede pricing page visits
- Which case studies correlate with demo requests
- Which email campaigns drive return website visits

Double down on content that drives intent. Promote it more heavily, create similar pieces, and use it in nurture sequences.

### Refine ICP Based on Intent Patterns

Your theoretical ICP might not match who actually converts. Analyze closed deals to find common intent patterns:

- Which industries show the shortest time from first visit to closed deal?
- What company sizes demonstrate the highest intent-to-conversion rate?
- Which personas engage most deeply before purchasing?

Update your ICP and targeting criteria based on real behavioral data, not assumptions.

### Optimize Channel Mix by Intent Source

Track which channels drive the highest-quality intent signals:

- Do LinkedIn ads generate more pricing page visits than Google Ads?
- Does organic search traffic show higher return visit rates than paid social?
- Do email campaigns drive deeper engagement than retargeting ads?

Shift budget toward channels that generate strong intent signals, not just traffic volume.

## Tactic 7: Re-Engage Dormant Leads Showing Renewed Intent

Your CRM contains leads who went cold months ago. Some of them are researching solutions again right now—you just don't know it.

Intent monitoring lets you re-engage old leads at the perfect moment:

### Identify Returning Contacts

Set up alerts when previously engaged contacts return to your site after extended inactivity. These warm re-engagement opportunities often convert faster than cold leads because you have prior relationship history.

### Trigger "We Noticed You're Back" Campaigns

When dormant leads return, acknowledge their renewed interest:

- Email: "Welcome back! Here's what's new since your last visit"
- Offer: Exclusive demo or consultation for returning prospects
- Content: Updates on features or capabilities they previously researched

### Prioritize Dormant Leads with High Intent

A lead who went cold six months ago but just visited your pricing page three times this week is hotter than a brand new contact who read one blog post. Score and prioritize accordingly.

Cursive tracks visitor behavior across time, flagging when previously known contacts return and exhibit renewed buying signals. These re-engagement opportunities often produce the fastest ROI because trust is already established. Combine this with [multifactor audience segmentation for campaign success](/blog/34-multifactor-audience-segmentation-for-campaign-success).

## Measuring Intent-Based Marketing Success

Track these metrics to validate your intent-based approach:

### Lead Quality Metrics

- **Conversion rate by intent score**: High-intent leads should convert at 2-4x the rate of cold leads
- **Sales acceptance rate**: What percentage of intent-qualified leads do sales teams follow up with?
- **Opportunity creation rate**: How many intent-qualified leads turn into pipeline?

### Velocity Metrics

- **Lead response time**: How quickly do you engage high-intent accounts?
- **Time to opportunity**: How long from first intent signal to qualified opportunity?
- **Sales cycle length**: Do intent-sourced deals close faster?

### Pipeline Contribution

- **Intent-sourced pipeline value**: What percentage of your pipeline originates from intent signals?
- **Win rate by source**: Do intent-sourced deals close at higher rates?
- **ROI by intent channel**: Which intent sources drive the highest return?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is intent-based marketing?

Intent-based marketing targets prospects based on behavioral signals that indicate active buying interest, rather than static demographic attributes. Instead of reaching out to everyone in a target industry, you focus on accounts showing real-time research behavior like pricing page visits, competitor comparisons, and content downloads.

### How do you collect intent data?

Intent data comes from two sources: first-party data from your own properties (website visits, content engagement, email opens) and third-party data showing research behavior across external sites (industry publications, competitor pages, review platforms). Platforms like Cursive combine both sources for complete visibility.

### What are the most important intent signals to track?

The strongest B2B intent signals include repeated visits to pricing pages, product demo requests, case study downloads, integration documentation research, and return visits within short timeframes. Multiple signals occurring together (like pricing page visit + case study download) indicate higher intent than single actions.

### How quickly should you act on intent signals?

Speed matters. When accounts show high intent, reach out within 24 hours. Intent windows are short—most B2B buyers complete research and make decisions within weeks. Delayed response means competitors get there first.

### Can small teams use intent-based marketing?

Absolutely. Automation makes intent-based marketing accessible to small teams. Platforms like Cursive automatically track behavior, score accounts, and trigger campaigns—no manual monitoring required. Small teams can prioritize high-intent accounts and avoid wasting time on cold outreach.

### How do you personalize outreach based on intent?

Reference specific content prospects engaged with in your messaging. If they viewed healthcare case studies, lead with healthcare success stories. If they researched Salesforce integration, mention CRM connectivity. Intent data tells you what they care about—use that insight to make outreach relevant.

### What's a good conversion rate for intent-qualified leads?

Intent-qualified leads typically convert 2-4x better than cold leads. If your overall lead-to-opportunity conversion rate is 10%, intent-qualified leads should convert at 20-40%. The exact ratio depends on your scoring criteria and how aggressively you filter for high intent.

### How does Cursive support intent-based marketing?

Cursive identifies up to 70% of anonymous website visitors, tracks 450 billion+ monthly intent signals across 30,000+ categories, scores accounts based on firmographic fit and behavioral intent, and syncs data into your CRM and marketing automation platforms via 200+ native integrations. This creates a complete intent-based marketing engine without custom development.
