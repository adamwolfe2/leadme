    question: "What is LeadIQ and what does it do?",
    answer: "LeadIQ is a B2B prospecting and contact data platform that helps sales teams find and verify contact information for potential prospects. Its core product is a Chrome extension that works alongside LinkedIn, letting reps capture emails and phone numbers of LinkedIn profiles they view and push them directly into their CRM or sales engagement tools. LeadIQ also offers a prospect database for bulk searching and real-time email verification to reduce bounce rates. It is primarily designed to support outbound cold prospecting workflows."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are people looking for LeadIQ alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common frustrations include running out of credits faster than expected (the credit-based model means costs scale with usage unpredictably), contact data that can be outdated or inaccurate especially for job changers, no ability to identify visitors who come to your own website, no outreach automation built into the platform, no AI personalization features, and per-user pricing that gets expensive as the team grows. Teams that want a more complete workflow from prospecting through booked meetings typically need to stack LeadIQ with several other tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to LeadIQ?",
    answer: "LeadIQ helps you find contact data for prospects you proactively search for — it is an outbound research tool. Cursive flips the model: instead of you hunting for prospects, Cursive identifies the people already coming to your website and automatically engages them. These warm visitors convert at significantly higher rates than cold outbound lists because they already know your company exists and have expressed interest by visiting your site. Cursive identifies individuals at up to 70% match rates with names, emails, and LinkedIn profiles, then triggers an AI SDR to send personalized outreach automatically — no manual prospecting research required."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Cursive have a LinkedIn prospecting feature?",
    answer: "Cursive does not have a Chrome extension for scraping LinkedIn profiles the way LeadIQ does. Instead, Cursive identifies visitors who come to your website and includes their LinkedIn profile as part of the enriched contact record, then automatically sends LinkedIn connection requests and messages through the AI SDR as part of a multi-channel outreach sequence. This means your LinkedIn outreach targets warm prospects who already visited your site rather than cold profiles you browsed manually — which typically produces much higher acceptance and response rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the main difference between LeadIQ and Cursive?",
    answer: "The fundamental difference is the direction of prospecting. LeadIQ is outbound-first: you find prospects on LinkedIn, capture their data, and cold outreach to them. Cursive is inbound-first: you capture prospects who are already inbound to your website, enrich their contact data automatically, and engage them with personalized AI outreach. Both approaches can work in B2B, but warm inbound prospects who have already visited your site tend to convert into meetings at 3-5x the rate of cold outbound contacts. Cursive also costs $1,000/mo all-in for unlimited usage, whereas LeadIQ costs $75–$140/user/month with credit limitations and requires additional tools for sequencing and automation."

                LeadIQ built its reputation as a sales rep&apos;s best friend on LinkedIn. The Chrome extension that captures
                verified emails and phone numbers as you browse profiles made outbound prospecting significantly faster.
                For SDR teams running high-volume cold outreach, that friction reduction mattered. But the landscape of
                B2B prospecting has shifted considerably, and the gaps in LeadIQ&apos;s model are becoming harder to ignore.
              </p>

              <p>
                After talking with revenue teams throughout 2025 and into 2026, we consistently heard the same
                complaints: credits running out before the end of the month, contact data that lags behind job
                changes, no visibility into who is visiting their website, and no built-in mechanism to actually
                reach out once you have a contact. LeadIQ is a research tool that stops at data — what most
                teams need is a complete workflow from prospect identification to booked meeting.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this guide, we compare seven LeadIQ alternatives across the dimensions that matter most:
                contact data quality, visitor identification, outreach automation, pricing model, and
                multi-channel capability. Whether you are replacing LeadIQ entirely or looking to complement it,
                this comparison will help you decide.

              <h2>Why Companies Are Looking for LeadIQ Alternatives</h2>

              <p>
                LeadIQ serves a specific workflow well: LinkedIn-based research and email capture for SDR
                cold outbound. But as B2B sales motions have matured, five pain points drive teams
                to seek alternatives.
              </p>

                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 5 Pain Points with LeadIQ</h3>
                <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                    <span><strong>Credits run out faster than expected:</strong> LeadIQ&apos;s credit-based model means
                    your team&apos;s prospecting velocity is capped by how many credits you have purchased. High-performing
                    SDRs can burn through credits in days, leaving the team waiting for the next billing period or
                    paying for expensive credit top-ups mid-cycle.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                    <span><strong>No website visitor identification:</strong> LeadIQ only helps you find contacts
                    for prospects you already know to target. It has no ability to identify the warm leads —
                    often your most interested prospects — who are already visiting your own website and browsing
                    your pricing and features pages.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                    <span><strong>No outreach automation:</strong> LeadIQ delivers contact data, but once you have it,
                    you still need a separate email sequencing tool, LinkedIn automation platform, and CRM
                    to actually run your outreach. This creates manual work and delays between capturing a contact
                    and making the first touch.</span>

                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">

                    <span><strong>Data quality issues for job changers:</strong> Contact databases are always fighting
                    data decay. When prospects change jobs (which happens at roughly 30% annual rates in some
                    industries), their contact information becomes stale. Teams report meaningful bounce rates
                    from LeadIQ data, especially for mid-market and startup contacts who move frequently.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                    <span><strong>Per-user costs scale painfully:</strong> At $75–$140 per user per month (paid
                    annually), a team of 5 SDRs costs $4,500–$8,400/year just for LeadIQ — before adding the
                    email tool, LinkedIn automation, and CRM integrations they still need. Total stack costs
                    can reach $20,000–$30,000/year for a small team.</span>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>
                These limitations are especially acute for growth-stage companies that need to move fast and maximize
                conversion from every prospecting dollar. Let us look at the alternatives that address these gaps.

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Apollo.io is LeadIQ&apos;s most direct competitor — it offers
                  a massive database of B2B contacts (275M+ records), a Chrome extension similar to LeadIQ&apos;s,
                  and a built-in email sequencing tool. If your primary complaint about LeadIQ is that it does not
                  include outreach automation, Apollo addresses that. The free tier is generous for small teams
                  getting started. However, Apollo still relies on a credit-based model, has no website visitor
                  identification, and contact data quality can be inconsistent at scale.

                  for capturing contact data from LinkedIn and company websites, with a clean interface and simple
                  setup. For individual contributors or very small teams that need basic email and phone lookup
                  without LeadIQ&apos;s per-user price, Lusha is a reasonable alternative. Like LeadIQ, it is a data tool
                  without outreach automation or visitor identification.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Hunter.io specializes in email discovery from company
                  domains — you provide a company name or domain and Hunter returns the email addresses it has
                  found on that domain, with a confidence score for each. Unlike LeadIQ which integrates with LinkedIn,
                  Hunter is more useful when you already know the company and role but need to find the email format.
                  It is simpler, cheaper, and more transparent about data sourcing (public web data only).
                  For teams with limited budgets doing targeted outbound to named accounts, Hunter is a practical
                  starting point.

              <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

              <p>
                The pricing model difference between LeadIQ and its alternatives is significant. Here is a
                realistic cost comparison for a team of 4 SDRs with 10,000 monthly website visitors.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>LeadIQ + required add-ons:</strong> LeadIQ ($75-140/user/mo × 4 users = $300-560/mo)
                + email sequencing tool ($200/mo) + LinkedIn automation ($150/mo) + CRM integration = approximately
                $650-$910/mo for a fragmented stack that still requires manual data capture and does not identify
                website visitors.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Cursive all-in-one:</strong> Starting at $1,000/month, you get person-level website visitor
                identification, AI SDR automation, multi-channel outreach across email,
                LinkedIn, and <Link href="/direct-mail">direct mail</Link>, plus{" "}
                <Link href="/what-is-lead-enrichment">lead enrichment</Link> — without per-user costs, credit limits,
                or manual prospecting research. Critically, these are warm leads already on your site, not cold
                contacts from a database. Visit our <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link> for details.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Apollo alternative:</strong> Apollo.io ($49/user/mo × 4 users = $196/mo) is more affordable
                than LeadIQ and includes email sequencing, making it the best pure-play LeadIQ replacement for
                teams that want to stay in the outbound database model.
              </p>

              {/* Bottom Line */}
              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                LeadIQ is a solid tool for its specific use case: helping SDRs capture contact data from LinkedIn
                and push it into their CRM for cold outreach. If that workflow works for your team, Apollo.io
                is a stronger version of the same model with built-in sequencing at a lower per-user price.
              </p>

              <p>
                But if you want to fundamentally improve conversion rates rather than just optimizing cold outbound,
                the more significant shift is moving from hunting cold contacts to engaging warm visitors.
                The people already browsing your website have already done the research, already know you exist,
                and are significantly more likely to convert than anyone from a prospecting database.{" "}
                <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> identifies those visitors at the person level, enriches their contact data,
                and automatically engages them through AI-powered outreach — without a single credit limit or
                manual LinkedIn search.

              <h2>About the Author</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Adam Wolfe</strong> is the founder of Cursive. After working with B2B sales teams stuck in
                credit-limited prospecting tools and manual outbound workflows, he built Cursive to flip the model —
                automatically identifying and engaging the warm prospects already coming to your website, so your
                team can stop hunting cold contacts and start converting warm ones.

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">What is LeadIQ and what does it do?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">LeadIQ is a B2B prospecting and contact data platform with a Chrome extension that works alongside LinkedIn, letting reps capture verified emails and phone numbers of LinkedIn profiles and push them into CRM or sales engagement tools. It also offers a prospect database and real-time email verification, primarily designed for outbound cold prospecting workflows.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Why are people looking for LeadIQ alternatives?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Most common frustrations: credits run out faster than expected, no ability to identify website visitors, no built-in outreach automation, data can be outdated especially for job changers, no AI personalization, and per-user pricing that gets expensive as the team grows. Teams wanting a complete workflow from prospecting to booked meetings need to stack LeadIQ with several other tools.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">How does Cursive compare to LeadIQ?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">LeadIQ helps you find contact data for prospects you proactively search for — it's an outbound research tool. Cursive identifies people already coming to your website and automatically engages them. These warm visitors convert at significantly higher rates because they already know your company and have expressed interest. Cursive provides ~70% person-level match rates and triggers AI SDR outreach automatically — no manual prospecting required.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Does Cursive have a LinkedIn prospecting feature?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Cursive does not have a Chrome extension for scraping LinkedIn profiles. Instead, Cursive includes visitor LinkedIn profiles in enriched contact records and automatically sends LinkedIn connection requests and messages through the AI SDR as part of multi-channel outreach sequences. This targets warm prospects who already visited your site — producing higher acceptance and response rates than cold LinkedIn outreach.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">What&apos;s the main difference between LeadIQ and Cursive?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">The fundamental difference is prospecting direction. LeadIQ is outbound-first: you find prospects on LinkedIn, capture their data, and cold outreach to them. Cursive is inbound-first: it captures prospects already inbound to your website, enriches contact data automatically, and engages them with personalized AI outreach. Warm inbound prospects convert at 3-5x the rate of cold outbound contacts. Cursive also costs $1,000/mo all-in vs. LeadIQ's $75–$140/user/mo with credit limitations plus additional tools needed for sequencing.</p>
