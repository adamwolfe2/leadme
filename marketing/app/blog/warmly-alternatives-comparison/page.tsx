    question: "What is Warmly and what does it do?",
    answer: "Warmly is a website visitor identification and revenue orchestration platform that identifies companies and individuals visiting your website in real time. It reveals visitor names, job titles, companies, and contact information, then surfaces these insights through integrations with tools like Slack, Salesforce, and HubSpot. Warmly focuses on helping sales teams engage high-intent website visitors at the moment they are most interested in your product."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are companies looking for Warmly alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons include Warmly's pricing, which starts at $700 per month for the Business plan and goes to $1,400 or more per month for Enterprise, limited outbound capabilities beyond visitor identification, data accuracy concerns with person-level matching, no built-in AI outreach or multi-channel campaign tools, and the need for a more complete platform that combines visitor identification with outbound engagement rather than just surfacing leads for manual follow-up."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the most affordable Warmly alternative?",
    answer: "Leadfeeder by Dealfront offers company-level visitor tracking starting at around $99 per month, making it the most budget-friendly option. RB2B offers a free tier for basic person-level identification. Cursive offers self-serve credits starting at $99 that include person-level identification plus AI-powered outreach, providing more complete functionality at an accessible entry point."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Cursive a good Warmly alternative?",
    answer: "Yes, Cursive is an excellent Warmly alternative, particularly for teams that want more than just visitor identification. While Warmly identifies visitors and surfaces them for manual follow-up, Cursive combines visitor identification with intent data scoring and AI-powered multi-channel outreach in one platform. Cursive identifies visitors at the person level with approximately 70 percent match rates, then automatically engages them with personalized email, LinkedIn, and direct mail sequences. This eliminates the gap between identification and outreach that Warmly leaves for your team to fill manually."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Warmly include outbound outreach tools?",
    answer: "Warmly includes basic orchestration features that can trigger actions in other tools, such as adding visitors to sequences in your sales engagement platform. However, it does not include built-in AI outreach, email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, or direct mail capabilities. You need to pair Warmly with separate outreach tools to actually engage the visitors it identifies. Cursive, by contrast, includes AI-powered multi-channel outreach as a core feature, eliminating the need for additional tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Warmly compare to RB2B for visitor identification?",
    answer: "Both Warmly and RB2B offer person-level visitor identification, but they differ in scope and pricing. RB2B is simpler and more focused, delivering visitor IDs primarily through Slack notifications with a free tier available. Warmly offers more features including CRM integrations, chat capabilities, and basic orchestration, but at a higher price point starting at $700 per month. For teams that want visitor identification combined with automated outreach, Cursive provides both capabilities in one platform."

              Warmly helps you see who is visiting your website, but at $700-$1,400+/mo with no built-in outbound

              Warmly has carved out a solid niche in the{" "}
              <Link href="/visitor-identification">website visitor identification</Link> space. For teams that want
              to know exactly who is browsing their website in real time, Warmly delivers that visibility with
              person-level identification, CRM integrations, and Slack notifications. It does one thing and does
              it reasonably well.
            </p>

            <p>
              But here is the challenge: knowing who visits your website is only valuable if you can do something
              about it. Warmly identifies visitors but leaves the engagement gap for your team to fill. You still
              need to manually look up contacts, craft outreach, manage sequences, and coordinate across channels.
              At $700 to $1,400+ per month, many teams question whether identification alone justifies the investment,
              especially when alternatives offer identification plus built-in outreach at comparable or lower prices.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this guide, we compare seven Warmly alternatives across visitor identification,{" "}
              <Link href="/what-is-b2b-intent-data">intent data</Link>, outbound tools, CRM integration, pricing,
              and ideal use cases. Whether you need a more complete platform or simply a more affordable identification

            <h2>Why Companies Are Looking for Warmly Alternatives</h2>

            <p>
              Warmly is a capable visitor identification tool, but it has limitations that drive many teams to
              explore alternatives. Here are the four most common pain points we hear from teams evaluating
              their options.
            </p>

            <div className="not-prose bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-red-200">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 4 Pain Points with Warmly</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                  <span><strong>Pricing starts at $700/mo and climbs to $1,400+/mo:</strong> Warmly&apos;s Business
                  plan starts at around $700 per month, and the Enterprise tier reaches $1,400 or more per month.
                  For a tool focused primarily on visitor identification, this pricing feels steep compared to
                  alternatives that include outbound capabilities at similar or lower price points. Teams often find
                  they are paying for identification alone and then spending additional budget on separate outreach
                  tools to actually engage those visitors.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                  <span><strong>Limited outbound tools and no built-in AI outreach:</strong> Warmly excels at showing
                  you who is on your website, but it does not help you reach them. There is no built-in email
                  sequencing, no LinkedIn automation, no direct mail integration, and no AI SDR to craft personalized
                  outreach. You identify high-intent visitors in Warmly, then switch to a completely separate tool to
                  engage them. This creates a workflow gap that slows down response time and requires additional
                  software spend.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                  <span><strong>Data accuracy concerns with person-level matching:</strong> While Warmly offers
                  person-level visitor identification, the match rates and accuracy can be inconsistent. Some users
                  report receiving visitor identifications that do not align with actual website traffic patterns,
                  or seeing match rates lower than expected for their traffic volume. Data accuracy is the foundation
                  of any visitor identification tool, and inconsistencies erode trust in the entire workflow.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">4.</span>
                  <span><strong>Identification without intent is noisy:</strong> Knowing someone visited your website
                  is useful, but not every visitor is a qualified prospect. Warmly provides basic visit data like
                  pages viewed and time on site, but it lacks sophisticated intent scoring that distinguishes a
                  casual browser from a serious evaluator. Without strong intent signals, sales teams waste time
                  following up with visitors who have no real buying interest, which reduces the ROI of the
                  identification data.</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              Warmly remains a decent option for teams that specifically need visitor identification with CRM
              integrations and do not mind managing separate outreach tools. But the market now offers platforms
              that close the gap between identification and engagement in a single product. Let us examine the
              best alternatives.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>What makes it different:</strong> RB2B is the simplest Warmly alternative on this list. It
                focuses exclusively on person-level visitor identification delivered through real-time Slack
                notifications. When someone visits your website, RB2B identifies them and sends your team a Slack
                message with the visitor&apos;s name, title, company, and LinkedIn profile. That is essentially the
                entire product. There are no complex dashboards, no orchestration workflows, and no outreach tools.
                This extreme simplicity is RB2B&apos;s selling point. For teams that found Warmly overcomplicated for
                what they actually use it for (knowing who is on the site), RB2B strips it down to the essential
                signal. The free tier makes it risk-free to try.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Clearbit, now integrated into HubSpot as Breeze Intelligence,
                brings visitor identification and data enrichment natively into the HubSpot ecosystem. The Reveal
                feature identifies anonymous website visitors at the company level, while the enrichment engine
                automatically fills in firmographic, technographic, and employee data for contacts in your HubSpot
                CRM. For teams already running on HubSpot, this eliminates the need for a separate visitor identification
                tool entirely. You can trigger HubSpot workflows based on which companies are visiting specific pages,
                automatically enrich new leads as they come in, and use fit scoring to prioritize follow-up. The
                integration is seamless because it is built into HubSpot rather than bolted on through an API.

                <strong>What makes it different:</strong> 6sense is the enterprise heavyweight in this comparison.
                While Warmly focuses on visitor identification, 6sense wraps account identification into a comprehensive
                ABM platform that includes predictive analytics, third-party intent data, advertising orchestration,
                and buyer journey mapping. The platform uses AI to predict which accounts are most likely to buy, where
                they are in their buying journey, and when the optimal time to engage is. For enterprise teams running
                sophisticated ABM programs, 6sense provides a level of intelligence that Warmly cannot match. However,
                the price tag and implementation complexity put it in a completely different category, starting at
                $50,000+ per year with 6-12 week implementation timelines.

                its advertising capabilities. The platform combines account identification with targeted display
                advertising, allowing you to not only identify which accounts visit your website but also run targeted
                ad campaigns to those accounts across the web. Demandbase also includes website personalization,
                intent data, sales intelligence, and account-level analytics. For marketing teams whose strategy
                centers on advertising and awareness at target accounts, Demandbase provides a more integrated
                approach than Warmly plus a separate ad platform.

              For most teams switching from Warmly, the core question is: do you just want cheaper identification,
              or do you want a platform that turns identification into action? If it is the former, RB2B or
              Leadfeeder will save you money. If it is the latter,{" "}
              <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> eliminates the workflow gap by combining identification with automated
              outreach. Explore the <Link href="/platform">Cursive platform</Link> to see how the pieces fit together.

            {/* Bottom Line */}
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>
              Warmly does a solid job of answering the question &quot;who is on my website right now?&quot; But
              the real value is in what happens next. Identification is the starting line, not the finish line.
              The tools that generate the most pipeline are the ones that turn visitor data into personalized
              outreach before that buying intent fades.
            </p>

            <p>
              For teams that want the full identify-to-engage workflow in one platform,{" "}
              <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> combines person-level visitor identification, intent scoring, and
              AI-powered multi-channel outreach starting with self-serve credits at $99 or managed done-for-you
              campaigns at $1,000/mo. It replaces Warmly plus your outreach tool with a single integrated
              solution at better value.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you just need cheaper identification, RB2B gives you person-level data for free and Leadfeeder
              delivers company-level tracking from $99/mo. For HubSpot teams, Clearbit (Breeze) adds identification
              natively without another vendor. And for enterprise teams ready to invest, 6sense and Demandbase
              provide full ABM suites that include identification as one component of a much larger platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most important thing is to close the gap between identification and action. Every hour that
              passes between a prospect visiting your website and your team reaching out reduces the probability
              of engagement. Choose the tool that minimizes that gap for your team and budget. Start with
              a <Link href="/free-audit">free AI audit</Link> to see how your current visitor-to-pipeline
              conversion compares, or explore our <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link> to find the right
              Cursive plan for your team.
            </p>

            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Adam Wolfe</strong> is the founder of Cursive. After watching too many sales teams identify
              website visitors only to let them slip away without follow-up, he built Cursive to close the gap
              between knowing who visits and actually engaging them, automatically.

                <p className="font-bold mb-1">What is Warmly and what does it do?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Warmly is a website visitor identification and revenue orchestration platform that identifies companies and individuals visiting your website in real time. It reveals visitor names, job titles, companies, and contact information, then surfaces insights through integrations with Slack, Salesforce, and HubSpot.</p>

                <p className="font-bold mb-1">Why are companies looking for Warmly alternatives?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Most common reasons: Warmly's pricing ($700-$1,400+/mo), limited outbound capabilities beyond visitor identification, data accuracy concerns with person-level matching, no built-in AI outreach or multi-channel campaign tools, and the need for a complete platform that combines identification with outbound engagement.</p>

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold mb-1">What is the most affordable Warmly alternative?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Leadfeeder offers company-level tracking from $99/mo. RB2B offers free tier for basic person-level identification. Cursive offers self-serve credits from $99 with person-level ID plus AI-powered outreach.</p>

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold mb-1">Is Cursive a good Warmly alternative?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes. Cursive combines visitor identification with intent data scoring and AI-powered multi-channel outreach in one platform. Identifies visitors at person level (70% match rate), then automatically engages with personalized email, LinkedIn, and direct mail sequences. Eliminates gap between identification and outreach.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold mb-1">Does Warmly include outbound outreach tools?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Warmly includes basic orchestration features that trigger actions in other tools. Does not include built-in AI outreach, email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, or direct mail. You need separate outreach tools to engage identified visitors. Cursive includes AI-powered multi-channel outreach as core feature.</p>
