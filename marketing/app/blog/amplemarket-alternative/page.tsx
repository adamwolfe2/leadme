    question: "What is Amplemarket and what does it do?",
    answer: "Amplemarket is an AI-powered sales engagement platform built primarily for SDR teams. It automates cold outreach through email sequences, LinkedIn automation, and AI-written messaging. Amplemarket positions itself as an AI co-pilot for sales reps, handling prospecting list building, personalized email copy, follow-up sequencing, and LinkedIn connection and message automation. It starts at roughly $1,000-$2,000+ per month depending on team size and usage."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are sales teams looking for Amplemarket alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons teams look for Amplemarket alternatives include: high monthly cost for what is essentially cold outreach automation, no real-time website visitor identification (meaning you are only reaching cold prospects, never warm visitors), no intent data to know who is actively researching your category, no lead marketplace for flexible per-lead purchasing, and limited channels outside of email and LinkedIn. Teams that want to go beyond cold outreach and capture warm, already-interested visitors are the primary movers."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Amplemarket have website visitor identification?",
    answer: "No. Amplemarket does not offer website visitor identification. It is designed around building lists of cold prospects and automating outreach to them. This is a fundamental limitation: you are always starting from cold. Amplemarket has no way to tell you when a target account visits your site, which pages they viewed, or how many times they have come back. All of that warm, high-intent traffic remains completely invisible to Amplemarket users."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Amplemarket?",
    answer: "Cursive and Amplemarket both automate outreach, but they approach it from completely different starting points. Amplemarket starts cold: it helps you build lists of prospects you have never interacted with and automates outreach to them. Cursive starts warm: it installs a pixel on your website, identifies up to 70% of your anonymous visitors in real time, matches them to its database of 280M US consumer and 140M+ business profiles, then fires automated outreach when those warm signals appear. Cursive also covers email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail, compared to Amplemarket's email and LinkedIn focus."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the pricing difference between Amplemarket and Cursive?",
    answer: "Amplemarket pricing typically starts around $1,000-$2,000+ per month depending on team size, seat count, and usage volume. Cursive's managed plan is $1,000/month all-in and includes visitor identification, intent data, AI SDR outreach across four channels, and 200+ CRM integrations. For teams that want flexible purchasing without a monthly commitment, Cursive also offers a self-serve marketplace at leads.meetcursive.com where you can buy leads at $0.60 each."
  },
  {
    question: "What Amplemarket alternative is best for capturing warm website traffic?",
    answer: "Cursive is the strongest Amplemarket alternative for capturing warm website traffic. Where Amplemarket can only reach cold lists, Cursive identifies up to 70% of your anonymous website visitors by name, email, job title, company, and LinkedIn profile in real time. When a target account visits your pricing page or comes back for the third time, Cursive can trigger an immediate, personalized outreach sequence. This real-time warm signal approach consistently outperforms cold outreach because you are reaching people who have already shown active interest in your product."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Cursive as a drop-in Amplemarket replacement?",
    answer: "Yes, and in most cases Cursive replaces both Amplemarket and your data provider in a single platform. Amplemarket requires you to bring your own prospect lists or use its built-in prospecting. Cursive surfaces warm prospects automatically from your own website traffic, supplements with intent audiences (people researching your category across 30,000+ topics), and includes the outreach automation to reach them across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail. Most teams replacing Amplemarket with Cursive also eliminate one or two other tools from their stack."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Cursive have a free trial or a lower-commitment option?",
    answer: "Cursive does not offer a traditional free trial for the managed plan, but the self-serve marketplace at leads.meetcursive.com lets you purchase leads at $0.60 each with no monthly commitment. This is a good way to evaluate data quality and fit before committing to the full platform. You can also book a demo at cal.com/cursive/30min to see visitor identification and intent data against your actual website traffic before making any commitment."

                Amplemarket built a real following by combining AI-written email copy, LinkedIn automation, and
                multi-step sequencing into a single platform. For SDR teams running high-volume cold outreach,
                it reduces the manual work of personalization and follow-up significantly.
              </p>

              <p>
                But Amplemarket has a structural limitation that no amount of AI copy can fix: it only works
                on cold prospects. It has no way to tell you who is visiting your website right now, which target
                accounts have come back three times this week, or which of your outbound targets are simultaneously
                researching your category. That entire layer of warm, high-intent signal is invisible to
                Amplemarket users.
              </p>

                In this guide, we compare seven Amplemarket alternatives across visitor identification, intent data,
                outreach channels, pricing, and overall approach. Whether you want to replace Amplemarket entirely
                or add the warm-signal layer it is missing, this comparison will help you pick the right tool.

              <h2>Why Sales Teams Are Moving Away from Amplemarket</h2>

              <p>
                Amplemarket is a capable tool for what it does. But the companies moving away from it share a common
                frustration: they are spending $1,000-$2,000+ per month on cold outreach automation while the warmest
                prospects — people already visiting their website — go completely unidentified.
              </p>

                    <span><strong>Cold-only visibility:</strong> Amplemarket has no pixel, no visitor identification,
                    and no way to alert you when a target account visits your site. Every sequence starts cold,
                    regardless of whether that prospect visited your pricing page three times last week.
                    The warmest leads in your funnel remain completely invisible.</span>

                    <span><strong>No real-time intent signals:</strong> Amplemarket does not tell you who is
                    actively researching your category right now. Without intent data, you are prospecting based
                    on firmographic fit alone, reaching out to companies that match your ICP but may not be in
                    an active buying cycle. Timing is as important as fit, and Amplemarket provides no timing signals.</span>

                    automation, Amplemarket competes directly with tools like Cursive that include visitor identification,
                    intent data, and multi-channel outreach for $1,000/mo. If you are paying Amplemarket prices
                    and still missing your warm website traffic, the ROI math does not work.</span>

                    but does not include direct mail. For teams targeting enterprise buyers where physical touchpoints
                    drive meaningful differentiation, this is a missing channel that requires a separate tool and

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Amplemarket starts every sequence cold. <Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link> starts
                  with the warmest signal available: people who have already visited your website and shown explicit interest
                  in what you sell. Cursive installs a lightweight pixel, identifies up to 70% of anonymous visitors in real
                  time, matches them to its database of 280M US consumer and 140M+ business profiles, then automatically
                  fires personalized outreach when intent signals fire. The result is that you are reaching people at
                  exactly the right moment — when they are actively in-market — rather than hoping your cold sequence
                  arrives at the right time.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Beyond visitor identification, Cursive also scans 60B+ behaviors and URLs weekly across 30,000+ intent
                  categories to surface companies actively researching your space even before they visit your site. The
                  AI SDR then reaches those prospects across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail, with outreach
                  triggered by real-time behavioral signals rather than static cadence timers.

                  Apollo&apos;s paid plans start at $49/user/month and include a 275M+ contact database, built-in email
                  sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and AI-assisted email writing. For teams where budget is the primary
                  constraint, Apollo provides significant capability at a fraction of Amplemarket&apos;s price. The
                  limitation Apollo shares with Amplemarket: no visitor identification and no real-time intent signals.

                  combined with Salesforce and HubSpot routing. Warmly is often used alongside cold outreach tools like
                  Amplemarket as a warm-signal layer. However, at $3,500/mo and with only company-level (not person-level)

                  Outreach is the enterprise-grade sales engagement platform that Amplemarket is often positioned against
                  on the low end. Where Amplemarket markets to SMB and mid-market SDR teams, Outreach is built for large
                  sales organizations with dedicated RevOps teams, complex approval workflows, and deep Salesforce
                  integrations. Outreach includes call recording, deal management, revenue forecasting, and conversation
                  intelligence alongside traditional sequencing. For teams graduating from Amplemarket due to scale rather
                  than warm-signal gaps, Outreach is the natural upgrade. It does not solve the visitor identification
                  problem, but it handles enterprise sequencing complexity well.

                  Salesloft competes directly with Outreach at the enterprise end and positions above Amplemarket on

                  deal inspection into a revenue orchestration platform. Salesloft also includes some basic buyer intent
                  signals through its Rhythm product, which surfaces engagement signals from website visits and content
                  interactions — though this is company-level and far less comprehensive than dedicated intent platforms.
                  For teams leaving Amplemarket due to scale requirements or needing deal intelligence, Salesloft is a
                  strong option.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Reply.io is a multichannel sales automation platform that covers email, LinkedIn, SMS, WhatsApp, and
                  calls. At $49/user/month starting price, it is substantially cheaper than Amplemarket and covers more
                  channels. Reply includes an AI email assistant for personalization and supports conditional sequence
                  branching. It is a strong budget alternative for teams that primarily need cold outreach sequencing
                  without the premium AI features or the warm-signal capabilities. Like Amplemarket, Reply has no visitor
                  identification or real-time intent data.

                  Klenty is a sales engagement platform designed for smaller teams, covering email, LinkedIn, calls,
                  SMS, and WhatsApp. It is known for strong CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho)
                  and flexible per-step personalization using Liquid Templates. Klenty sits below Amplemarket on both
                  price and AI sophistication, making it a sensible option for SMB teams where Amplemarket feels
                  overbuilt and overpriced. It shares the same limitation as every other cold outreach tool: no visitor
                  identification, no real-time intent signals.

              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                Amplemarket is a capable cold outreach tool. But in 2026, the highest-performing B2B sales teams are
                not starting their sequences cold. They are starting with warm signals: who is visiting right now,
                which accounts are actively researching your category, which visitors have returned multiple times
                without converting.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you are spending $1,000-$2,000/mo on Amplemarket and your warm website traffic is going completely
                unidentified, the opportunity cost is significant. Every visitor Amplemarket cannot see is a warm
                prospect being reached cold — or not reached at all.
              </p>
