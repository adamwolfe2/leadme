    question: "What is B2B data?",
    answer: "B2B data (business-to-business data) is any structured information about businesses and the professionals who work within them. It includes contact data (names, emails, phone numbers), firmographic data (company size, industry, revenue, location), technographic data (software and tools a company uses), intent data (signals indicating active buying research), and behavioral data (website visits, content engagement, event attendance). B2B sales and marketing teams use this data to identify ideal prospects, prioritize outreach, personalize messaging, and measure campaign effectiveness."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the main types of B2B data?",
    answer: "There are five primary types of B2B data: (1) Contact data — names, job titles, email addresses, direct phone numbers, LinkedIn URLs; (2) Firmographic data — company size, industry, revenue, location, employee count, growth rate; (3) Intent data — signals showing a company or individual is actively researching a topic or category, derived from content consumption across the web; (4) Behavioral data — website visit history, page views, content downloads, event attendance, email engagement; (5) Technographic data — the software stack a company uses, including CRM, marketing automation, infrastructure, and business applications."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between B2B data and B2C data?",
    answer: "B2B data focuses on businesses and the individuals who make purchasing decisions within them, used to target companies of specific sizes, industries, or revenue ranges. B2C (business-to-consumer) data focuses on individual consumers and their personal demographics, interests, purchase history, and household characteristics. B2B data is typically used for enterprise sales outreach, account-based marketing, and pipeline generation. B2C data is used for consumer advertising, e-commerce targeting, and direct-to-consumer marketing."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes B2B data good vs bad?",
    answer: "Good B2B data is accurate (verified and current), complete (full contact information including direct dials and work emails, not just generic info@), actionable (includes enough context to personalize outreach), fresh (regularly updated to account for job changes and company changes), and compliant (collected and processed in accordance with CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and CCPA). Bad B2B data is outdated (industry-average data decay is 30-40% annually due to job changes), incomplete (missing direct email or phone), inaccurate (wrong titles, closed companies), or non-compliant (collected without proper consent mechanisms)."
  },
  {
    question: "How is B2B data collected?",
    answer: "B2B data is collected through several methods: (1) Web scraping — automated collection of publicly available information from LinkedIn, company websites, and professional directories; (2) Data partnerships — cooperative sharing between data providers where companies contribute their own customer data in exchange for access to aggregated insights; (3) Form fills and opt-ins — contacts who fill out forms, register for events, or download content; (4) Intent data networks — tracking content consumption across publisher networks to identify research patterns; (5) Identity graphs — matching anonymous website visitors to known profiles using cookies, device fingerprinting, and email-based matching."
  },
  {
    question: "What is B2B intent data and how is it different from contact data?",
    answer: "Contact data tells you who someone is (name, email, job title, company). Intent data tells you what they are actively researching right now. Intent data is derived from tracking content consumption patterns across the web — which articles a person reads, which topics they research, which competitor websites they visit. When a company's employees are consuming content about a specific software category, that is an intent signal suggesting an active buying evaluation. Cursive scans 60B+ behaviors and URLs weekly across 30,000+ intent categories to surface companies showing active buying intent in your space."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive's approach to B2B data differ from static databases?",
    answer: "Traditional B2B data providers like ZoomInfo or Apollo maintain large static databases that are periodically refreshed. You query the database to find contacts matching your ICP, then export them for outreach. Cursive combines a static database (280M US consumer + 140M+ business profiles) with real-time dynamic signals: website visitor identification (70% of your anonymous visitors identified in real time), intent data (60B+ behaviors & URLs scanned weekly to surface active buyers), and behavioral data (page visits, visit frequency, pages viewed). This means Cursive surfaces the right person at the right moment rather than giving you a list of people who matched your criteria at some point in the past."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I look for when evaluating a B2B data provider?",
    answer: "Key criteria for evaluating B2B data providers include: match rate and coverage (what percentage of your target market is in their database), accuracy and freshness (how often data is verified and updated), data depth (do they have direct dials, work emails, and enrichment data beyond basic contact info), intent and behavioral signals (can they tell you who is in-market right now, not just who fits your ICP), integration compatibility (does it connect with your CRM and outreach tools), pricing model (per-contact, per-seat, or all-in pricing), and compliance (GDPR, CCPA, CAN-SPAM compliance for the geographies you sell into)."

                Every B2B sales and marketing motion — whether it is cold outreach, account-based marketing,
                retargeting, or content distribution — depends on data. The quality, type, and freshness of that
                data determines whether your outreach is relevant and timely or off-target and wasted.
              </p>

              <p>
                Yet most people working with B2B data have a surprisingly narrow definition of what it actually
                includes. They think of it as a list of company names and email addresses. In reality, B2B data
                encompasses five distinct types, each serving a different purpose in the sales and marketing workflow —
                and the most powerful modern approaches combine all of them in real time.
              </p>

              <h2>B2B Data Definition</h2>

              <p>
                B2B data is any structured information about businesses and the professionals who work within them
                that can be used to identify, qualify, prioritize, or reach potential customers. It is the raw
                material that powers prospecting, personalization, segmentation, and measurement in business-to-business
                sales and marketing.
              </p>

              <p>
                B2B data differs from B2C (business-to-consumer) data in its target: instead of individual consumer
                demographics and household data, B2B data focuses on organizational attributes (company size, industry,
                revenue) and professional attributes (job title, department, seniority, buying authority).
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the most overlooked quality issues in B2B data is <strong>data decay</strong>. Studies consistently
                show that B2B contact data degrades at 30-40% per year due to job changes, company restructuring, and
                email address formats changing. A database that was 90% accurate twelve months ago may be only 50-60%
                accurate today. This is why real-time enrichment and continuous verification matter so much.

              <h2>How Cursive Approaches B2B Data Differently</h2>

              <p>
                Most B2B data providers give you a static snapshot: a database of contacts you query, filter, and
                export. The data was accurate at some point in the past. You reach out to it, hoping the timing aligns
                with the prospect&apos;s buying cycle.
              </p>

              <p>
                Cursive combines all five data types — contact, firmographic, intent, behavioral, and technographic —
                with real-time signals:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>280M US consumer + 140M+ business profiles</strong> for contact and firmographic coverage</li>
                <li><strong>70% person-level visitor identification</strong> for real-time behavioral data from your own traffic</li>
                <li><strong>60B+ behaviors and URLs scanned weekly</strong> across 30,000+ categories for intent data</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time target account alerts</strong> when known accounts visit your website</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Instead of querying a static database and hoping prospects are in market, Cursive surfaces the right
                people at the moment they are showing buying signals — whether from your own website or from third-party
                intent networks. That timing advantage is what separates real-time B2B data from traditional database
                approaches.
              </p>
