December 10, 2025 Getting the right message to the right person doesn't have to feel like guesswork. When we pay attention to what people actually do, like what they click, read, or search, we can start grouping our audiences in much smarter ways. These actions give us a window into what matters to them right now, not just what they said a week ago. That’s where audience segmentation strategies based on buyer intent come in.

Rather than tossing everyone into one big group, we can sort them into clearer categories. These don't need to be complicated, but they should align with their actions. Here are some useful ways to group potential buyers: •
