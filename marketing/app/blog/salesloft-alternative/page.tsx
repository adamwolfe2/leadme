    question: "What is Salesloft and what does it do?",
    answer: "Salesloft is a sales engagement platform designed to help enterprise sales teams manage multi-step outreach cadences, track email opens and replies, record calls, and coordinate selling activities across the revenue team. It combines email sequencing, call logging, LinkedIn task management, and pipeline analytics in a single platform. Salesloft acquired Drift in 2023 and is now positioned as a 'Revenue Orchestration Platform' targeting mid-market to enterprise accounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are sales teams looking for Salesloft alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons sales teams seek Salesloft alternatives include: high per-user pricing ($75-$125/user/month) that compounds for large teams, no website visitor identification capability, no real-time intent data to prioritize outreach, a complex onboarding process that requires dedicated admin, and an enterprise-focused roadmap that leaves smaller teams underserved. Teams that need warm lead generation, not just a place to manage cold cadences, frequently outgrow or never fit Salesloft's model."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Salesloft cost?",
    answer: "Salesloft pricing is not publicly listed but typically falls in the $75-$125 per user per month range, billed annually with mandatory minimum seat counts. Most contracts require at least 10 users and annual commitments, putting the floor around $9,000-$15,000 per year. Enterprise features like advanced forecasting, deal intelligence, and conversation intelligence are often sold as additional add-ons. Total cost of ownership for a team of 10-20 reps commonly runs $120,000-$200,000 per year when fully deployed."
  },
  {
    question: "What Salesloft alternative includes visitor identification?",
    answer: "Cursive is the top Salesloft alternative that includes website visitor identification. While Salesloft only helps you manage and execute outreach cadences for contacts you already have in your system, Cursive installs a lightweight pixel on your website and identifies up to 70% of your anonymous visitors in real time, matching them to its database of 280M US consumer and 140M+ business profiles. This means you get warm, inbound-intent leads automatically, rather than relying purely on cold list-based prospecting."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Salesloft?",
    answer: "Cursive and Salesloft address fundamentally different problems. Salesloft is a cadence and engagement management tool — it helps you organize and execute outreach to contacts you already have. Cursive is an inbound-intent lead generation platform — it identifies who is already visiting your site, surfaces active buyers based on 60B+ weekly behavioral signals, and then automates personalized multi-channel outreach automatically. Cursive also costs $1,000/month all-in versus Salesloft's typical $75-$125 per user per month, making it dramatically more affordable for teams with more than 8-10 reps."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a cheaper alternative to Salesloft for small teams?",
    answer: "Yes. For smaller teams, Apollo.io offers email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and a contact database for $49-$99 per user per month. For teams that want to go beyond cold cadences and capture warm, high-intent visitors automatically, Cursive at $1,000/month flat provides visitor identification, intent data, and AI-powered outreach automation that replaces both Salesloft and the contact data provider you need alongside it. Cursive's self-serve marketplace at leads.meetcursive.com is also available at $0.60/lead for flexible, no-commitment access."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best Salesloft alternative for mid-market B2B teams?",
    answer: "For mid-market B2B teams that want the power of Salesloft's multi-channel cadence management combined with the ability to actually generate warm leads (not just execute against cold lists), Cursive is the strongest alternative. The platform's visitor identification catches buyers already researching your solution, its intent audience engine surfaces companies actively in-market, and the built-in AI SDR handles personalized outreach across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail without requiring a separate sequencing platform or contact data subscription."

                Salesloft is a powerful cadence management platform, but its enterprise pricing, lack of visitor
                identification, and focus on executing cold sequences leaves many teams looking for a platform that
                generates warm leads instead of just organizing them. Here are the seven best Salesloft alternatives.

                Salesloft built its reputation as one of the leading sales engagement platforms for enterprise revenue
                teams. The cadence builder, call logging, deal intelligence, and pipeline analytics made it a genuine
                step up from managing sequences in a spreadsheet. For large sales organizations with dedicated RevOps
                teams and six-figure software budgets, it still holds a strong position.
              </p>

              <p>
                But Salesloft&apos;s model has a fundamental limitation: it is a tool for executing outreach to contacts
                you already have. It does not tell you who is actively researching your product, who just visited your
                pricing page, or which companies are showing buying intent right now. In 2026, when the best sales
                teams are building pipeline from warm signals rather than cold lists, that gap is significant.
              </p>

              <p>
                Add the per-user pricing that compounds for any team larger than five reps, the mandatory annual
                contracts, and the complex onboarding process, and it is clear why so many teams are evaluating
                alternatives. In this guide, we compare seven Salesloft alternatives across outreach automation,
                visitor identification, intent data, pricing, and overall fit for modern B2B revenue teams.

              <h2>Why Sales Teams Are Moving Away from Salesloft</h2>

              <p>
                Salesloft&apos;s core value proposition is cadence management: organizing outreach sequences, tracking
                touchpoints, and ensuring reps follow a consistent sales process. For large enterprise teams with
                dedicated RevOps support, that value is real. But the model has structural limitations that push
                growing teams to look elsewhere.
              </p>

                    <span><strong>Enterprise pricing locks out smaller teams:</strong> At $75-$125 per user per month
                    with mandatory minimum seat counts and annual contracts, Salesloft is simply unaffordable for
                    teams under 10 reps. A 10-person team paying $100/user/month spends $12,000 per year on
                    sequencing alone, before accounting for the contact data provider they still need separately.</span>

                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                    <span><strong>No visitor identification capability:</strong> Salesloft has no way to tell you who is
                    visiting your website. Your hottest prospects — people actively researching your product right now —
                    remain completely invisible. You are executing cold cadences while warm, high-intent visitors go
                    uncontacted because you do not even know they exist.</span>

                    <span><strong>No built-in contact data:</strong> Salesloft is a sequencing and engagement platform
                    with no native contact database. Every contact you sequence must come from a separate data provider
                    like ZoomInfo, Apollo, or Lusha — adding $500-$2,000+/month to your stack before you send a
                    single email.</span>

                    <span><strong>Complex onboarding requiring RevOps resources:</strong> Deploying Salesloft
                    effectively requires dedicated configuration, admin time, and ongoing maintenance. For teams
                    without a full-time RevOps function, getting value from Salesloft often takes months and
                    requires professional services engagement at additional cost.</span>

                    <span><strong>Cold-first model in a warm-intent world:</strong> Salesloft was built for an
                    era when outbound meant cold list-based prospecting. In 2026, the highest-converting pipeline
                    comes from identifying warm visitors and in-market buyers first. Salesloft has no mechanism
                    for this inbound-intent workflow, leaving the highest-ROI leads untouched.</span>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Apollo is the most commonly recommended Salesloft alternative
                  because it bundles contact data (275M+ contacts) with email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and AI
                  email writing at a price point Salesloft cannot match. The generous free tier (10,000 records per month)
                  lets teams test before committing, and the jump to $49/user/month for paid plans is dramatically cheaper
                  than Salesloft. The trade-off is that Apollo is still primarily a cold prospecting tool with no visitor
                  identification and limited intent signals.

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Klenty targets SMB sales teams that find Salesloft overkill
                  but need more than a basic email tool. It focuses on email and LinkedIn cadence management with CRM
                  integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho), prospect tracking, and basic analytics. The
                  onboarding is significantly faster than enterprise platforms, and the per-user pricing at $50/month
                  makes it accessible for teams of 2-5 reps. Like other traditional sequencers, Klenty focuses entirely
                  on outbound execution — it has no mechanism for identifying warm visitors or surfacing in-market buyers.

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Groove, acquired by Clari, differentiates by being purpose-built

                  for teams where Salesforce data hygiene is critical. It includes email sequencing, call logging, meeting
                  scheduling, and activity tracking. The pricing is significantly lower than Salesloft ($19/user/month on
                  base plans), though enterprise features require higher tiers. The trade-off is that Groove is narrower
                  in scope — it is an execution layer for Salesforce, not a full revenue intelligence platform.

              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                Salesloft is a mature enterprise platform, but it was built for an era when pipeline came primarily
                from cold list-based prospecting. In 2026, the highest-converting B2B revenue teams are winning by
                identifying warm visitor intent, prioritizing in-market buyers, and reaching them at the right moment
                with the right message. No amount of cadence optimization changes the fundamental problem: you cannot
                sequence your way to great pipeline if you are starting from cold lists.
              </p>

              <p>
                If your primary reason for leaving Salesloft is cost, Apollo and Reply.io are the most direct
                replacements. If your reason for leaving is that you want to stop doing cold outbound and start
                capturing warm, high-intent visitors automatically, Cursive is the platform that addresses that
                problem directly.
