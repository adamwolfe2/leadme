                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>Demand generation</strong> is a marketing strategy focused on creating awareness and interest
                  in your product or service among buyers who are not yet actively looking to purchase. The goal is to
                  plant your brand in the minds of your ideal customers so that when they enter a buying process, you
                  are already a known, trusted option.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Unlike lead generation — which captures contact information from buyers already in-market — demand
                  generation works upstream. It educates, entertains, and builds credibility across the entire market,
                  not just the 5% actively buying at any given time.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Effective demand gen programs run across multiple channels: content marketing, SEO, paid social,
                  webinars, podcasts, and events. They are measured by pipeline influenced, not just MQL volume.

                  The most common confusion in B2B marketing is conflating demand gen with lead gen. They serve

                  Most high-growth B2B companies need both. Demand gen fills the top of the funnel with educated
                  prospects; lead gen converts them. Skipping demand gen means constantly fighting for attention
                  against competitors who have been building trust for years.

                      The highest-ROI demand gen channel long-term. Educational blog posts, comparison guides,
                      and how-to content rank in search engines and attract buyers actively researching your
                      category — without paying for each click. SEO demand gen compounds: a post written today
                      continues driving traffic and awareness for years. Focus on informational queries (what is,
                      how to, best practices) that your ICP searches before they know which vendor to use.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      LinkedIn is the primary paid demand gen channel for B2B because of its professional targeting
                      — you can reach specific job titles, company sizes, and industries. Run thought leadership
                      posts, video content, and ungated educational content to build familiarity before running
                      lead gen campaigns. Meta (Facebook/Instagram) works for B2B audiences at lower CPMs but
                      with less precise professional targeting.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Webinars generate the highest engagement of any demand gen format — attendees spend
                      30-60 minutes learning from you. They also collect strong intent signals: who attended,
                      which questions they asked, and what topics they engaged with most. On-demand webinar
                      libraries become evergreen demand gen assets that educate buyers 24/7.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Podcasts reach buyers in intimate, distraction-free moments — commutes, workouts, and
                      travel. Hosting a podcast positions your company as the category authority. Sponsoring
                      industry podcasts reaches established audiences of your ICP. Audio content builds
                      parasocial trust that is difficult to achieve through text or video alone.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      In-person and virtual events create high-quality brand impressions through face-to-face
                      interaction. Speaking at industry conferences positions your team as experts. Sponsoring
                      relevant events puts your brand in front of concentrated ICP audiences. Executive dinners
                      and roundtables are especially effective for enterprise demand gen.

                  The biggest mistake in demand gen measurement is optimizing for MQL volume. That incentivizes

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The fundamental challenge with demand gen is that most of the buyers you reach are not ready
                  to buy yet. You spend money building awareness across your entire market — but you cannot tell
                  which demand gen visitors are now in an active buying cycle.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Intent data solves this. By combining website visitor identification with third-party buying
                  signals, you can identify the subset of your demand gen audience that is actively in-market
                  right now — and route them to sales immediately instead of letting them drop into a 6-month
                  nurture sequence.

          <MachineSection title="What Is Demand Generation?">
            Demand generation is a B2B marketing strategy that creates awareness and interest in a product or service among buyers who are not yet ready to purchase. It encompasses content marketing, SEO, paid social, webinars, podcasts, and events designed to educate the market and build brand recognition before a buying process begins. Unlike lead generation, which captures contact information from in-market buyers, demand generation works upstream to warm the entire addressable market. It is measured by pipeline influenced, MQL-to-SQL rate, and cost per pipeline dollar rather than raw lead volume.
          </MachineSection>

          <MachineSection title="Demand Generation vs. Lead Generation">
            Demand generation creates demand where none existed; lead generation captures existing demand. Demand gen targets buyers not yet in an active evaluation; lead gen targets buyers already comparing vendors. Demand gen channels include blog posts, podcasts, webinars, and paid social awareness campaigns. Lead gen channels include gated content, demo requests, free trials, and contact forms. Best-practice B2B marketing programs use both: demand gen fills the funnel with educated prospects, lead gen converts them into pipeline. Demand gen ROI takes 6-18 months to materialize; lead gen produces immediate pipeline impact.

          <MachineSection title="Intent Data and Demand Generation">
            Intent data identifies which demand gen visitors are currently in an active buying window. By combining website visitor identification (70% identification rate) with third-party intent signals (450B+ signals refreshed weekly), platforms like <MachineLink href="https://www.meetcursive.com">Cursive</MachineLink> surface the subset of demand gen traffic actively researching solutions. This allows sales teams to prioritize immediate outreach to in-market buyers identified through demand gen channels rather than routing all demand gen leads into long nurture sequences. Cursive costs $1,000/month and provides access to 250M+ professional profiles.
