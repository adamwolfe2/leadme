    question: "What is SalesIntel and what does it do?",
    answer: "SalesIntel is a B2B contact data provider focused on human-verified accuracy. The company claims 95%+ accuracy on its contact records, compared to an industry average of 50-60%, by employing a team of human researchers to verify data points rather than relying solely on machine-generated records. SalesIntel's database includes 90M+ human-verified business contacts and is used primarily by sales and marketing teams for outbound prospecting, account-based marketing, and CRM enrichment. It also offers basic buyer intent data through a partnership with Bombora."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does SalesIntel cost? Is there a cheaper alternative?",
    answer: "SalesIntel's self-serve plans range from approximately $69 to $199 per user per month depending on features and data access, with enterprise plans at custom pricing. The per-seat model makes it expensive for larger teams. Cursive offers a fundamentally different pricing model starting at $0.60 per lead on a self-serve basis with no monthly commitment, or managed plans from $1,000 per month covering a full pipeline generation workflow. Apollo.io is the most budget-friendly alternative with a free tier and paid plans from $49 per user per month including a built-in sequencing platform. Lead411 offers Bombora intent data included from $99 per user per month."
  },
  {
    question: "What SalesIntel alternative includes visitor identification?",
    answer: "Cursive is the only alternative on this list that includes industry-leading website visitor identification. SalesIntel has no visitor identification capability at all -- it is a static database you search manually. Cursive installs a lightweight pixel on your website and identifies up to 70% of anonymous visitors in real time, matching them to its database of 220M+ consumer and 140M+ business profiles. This means instead of searching for people cold, you identify warm prospects who are already showing buying intent by visiting your site."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is SalesIntel data vs alternatives?",
    answer: "SalesIntel's human-verified approach delivers industry-leading contact accuracy at 95%+ for verified records. This is a genuine competitive advantage over Apollo (community-sourced, variable quality), ZoomInfo (algorithmic with machine verification), and Lusha (crowdsourced). However, SalesIntel's verified database is smaller (90M contacts) than alternatives like ZoomInfo (260M+) or Apollo (200M+). Cursive prioritizes real-time first-party identification data layered with 220M+ consumer profiles, which means the contacts it surfaces are not just accurate but actively in-market. For teams where data accuracy is the top priority, SalesIntel and Cognism lead the field. For teams that want accuracy combined with intent signals and automation, Cursive is the stronger choice."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best SalesIntel alternative for small businesses?",
    answer: "For small businesses, Cursive's self-serve marketplace at leads.meetcursive.com is the most flexible option at $0.60 per lead with no minimum commitment. You pay only for the leads you need. Apollo.io's free tier is also a strong starting point for very small teams -- it includes 10,000 records and basic sequencing at no cost. Lusha offers a free tier with 50 monthly credits for solo prospectors. SalesIntel's minimum pricing of $69 per user per month with annual contracts makes it one of the less accessible options for small businesses operating with tight budgets."
  },
  {
    question: "Does SalesIntel include AI outreach automation?",
    answer: "No, SalesIntel does not include built-in AI outreach automation. It is a data and intelligence platform that provides contact records, intent signals (via Bombora), and enrichment -- but you need a separate sales engagement platform to actually reach out to those contacts. This means teams using SalesIntel must pay separately for tools like Outreach, Salesloft, Instantly, or Apollo to execute sequences. Cursive is the only platform on this list that combines data, visitor identification, intent signals, and AI-powered multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, SMS, direct mail) in a single platform, eliminating the need to stitch together multiple tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to SalesIntel for B2B prospecting?",
    answer: "SalesIntel and Cursive serve different strategic approaches to pipeline generation. SalesIntel is a human-verified contact database that you actively search to build prospect lists for cold outreach. Cursive identifies people who are already showing buying intent -- either by visiting your website (70% person-level identification rate) or by matching against 450B+ behavioral intent signals -- and then automates personalized multi-channel outreach to them. Cursive's 220M+ consumer and 140M+ business profile database rivals SalesIntel on scale, and while Cursive's data is not human-verified in the same way, its real-time identification approach and intent-driven targeting delivers higher engagement rates than traditional cold prospecting from a static database. For teams who want automated pipeline generation rather than manual prospecting, Cursive delivers substantially more value."

              <h2>Why Teams Look for SalesIntel Alternatives</h2>
              <p>
                SalesIntel has carved out a strong niche in the B2B data market by betting on human verification.
                While most competitors rely on machine learning and algorithmic data collection, SalesIntel employs
                researchers to manually verify contact records -- delivering a claimed 95%+ accuracy rate that
                genuinely stands above most of the market. For sales teams burned by high bounce rates and
                disconnected numbers from low-quality data sources, that accuracy promise is compelling.
              </p>

              <p>
                But accuracy alone does not build a pipeline. The limitations of SalesIntel's approach push many
                teams toward alternatives that offer broader capabilities.
              </p>

                    <span><strong>Expensive per-seat pricing:</strong> At $69-$199/user/month for self-serve and custom pricing for enterprise, SalesIntel becomes costly for teams larger than a few reps. Annual contracts on enterprise plans add further rigidity.</span>

                    <span><strong>Smaller verified database:</strong> SalesIntel's 90M human-verified contacts is impressive for accuracy, but smaller than Apollo (200M+), ZoomInfo (260M+), or Cursive (140M+ business + 220M+ consumer). Coverage gaps arise for niche industries and smaller companies.</span>

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Clearbit, now integrated into HubSpot as Breeze
                  Intelligence, focuses on enriching your existing data rather than providing a prospecting
                  database to cold-search. Where SalesIntel helps you build lists from scratch, Clearbit enriches
                  your CRM, forms, and inbound leads with firmographic and company data. It also identifies which
                  companies are visiting your website -- though only at the company level, not person-level like Cursive.

                  verification approach. The key difference is geography: Cognism is optimized for EMEA markets
                  with GDPR-compliant data by design, while SalesIntel is US-focused. If you are switching from

              <h2>How to Choose the Right SalesIntel Alternative</h2>

              <p>
                The best SalesIntel alternative depends on what drove you to look in the first place. Here is a
                practical decision framework based on the most common reasons teams switch:
              </p>

              <h3>If You Want to Go Beyond Cold Database Prospecting:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong><Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link></strong>.
                Rather than searching a static database for cold contacts, Cursive identifies the people already
                visiting your website at an industry-leading{" "}
                <Link href="/visitor-identification" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">70% person-level match rate</Link>,
                enriches them with intent signals from 450B+ monthly behavioral data points, and automates
                personalized outreach -- all without a separate sales engagement platform.
              </p>

              <h3>If Cost Is the Primary Concern:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Apollo.io</strong> for a free tier or $49/user/month with built-in sequencing,
                or use <strong>Cursive's self-serve marketplace</strong> at $0.60/lead with no monthly minimum.
                Both are dramatically cheaper than SalesIntel's $69-$199/user/month per-seat model.
              </p>

              <h3>If Data Accuracy Is Still Your Top Priority:</h3>
              <p>
                If SalesIntel's human-verified accuracy is what you value most, <strong>Cognism</strong> offers
                a comparable verification-first philosophy (Diamond Data) with stronger EMEA coverage. For US
                markets with maximum data depth, <strong>ZoomInfo</strong> is the premium option -- though both
                cost significantly more than SalesIntel.
              </p>

              <h3>If Intent Data Is What You Valued in SalesIntel:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Lead411</strong> for Bombora intent data included at $99/user/month with unlimited
                lookups and trigger event signals. Or choose{" "}
                <strong><Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link></strong> for
                first-party intent signals from website behavior combined with 450B+ monthly behavioral data
                points -- which is more actionable than third-party Bombora data alone.
              </p>

              <h3>If You Need Simple, Affordable Contact Lookups:</h3>
              <p>
                Choose <strong>Lusha</strong> at $29-$79/user/month for accurate direct dials and email addresses
                from a LinkedIn-driven workflow, without the overhead of SalesIntel's per-seat pricing or
                enterprise contract requirements.
              </p>

              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                SalesIntel's human-verified accuracy is a genuine differentiator in a market full of algorithmic
                data providers delivering 50-60% accuracy on contact records. If cold outbound email and phone
                accuracy is your primary metric for success, SalesIntel and Cognism are the leaders in their
                respective geographies (US and EMEA).
              </p>

              <p>
                But for most B2B growth teams in 2026, the question is not just "how accurate is the data?" --
                it is "how do I build pipeline efficiently at scale?" Static databases, even perfectly verified
                ones, require manual prospecting workflows, separate outreach tools, and cold contact strategies
                that yield diminishing returns as buyers grow more resistant to unsolicited outreach.
              </p>

              <p>
                The alternatives on this list each address specific gaps: Cursive for AI-powered pipeline
                generation and visitor identification, Apollo for affordable database + sequencing, ZoomInfo for
                maximum US data depth, Lusha for cost-effective contact lookups, Lead411 for Bombora intent at
                lower cost, and Cognism for EMEA verification parity with SalesIntel's accuracy model.
              </p>

              <p>
                For teams ready to complement or replace static database prospecting,{" "}
                <Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursive</Link> represents the most
                significant evolution: identifying and converting the prospects who are already showing buying
                intent on your website, with AI-personalized outreach across every channel -- without annual
                contracts or the ongoing cost of separate sales engagement tools.

                <strong>Adam Wolfe</strong> is the founder of Cursive. After working with hundreds of B2B sales
                teams navigating the trade-offs between data accuracy, coverage, automation, and cost, he built
                Cursive to address the fundamental gap these tools leave: identifying and converting the
                prospects who are already showing interest by visiting your website.
