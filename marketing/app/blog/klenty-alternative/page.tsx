    question: "What is Klenty and what does it do?",
    answer: "Klenty is a sales engagement platform that automates multi-channel outbound sequences across email, phone, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp. It integrates with major CRMs like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive to sync contact activity and sequences. Sales teams use Klenty to run outbound campaigns at scale using contact lists they build or import from a separate data source."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are sales teams looking for Klenty alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons include per-seat pricing ($60–$125/user/month) that scales painfully with team size, no website visitor identification so you are always working cold lists rather than warm intent data, no AI email writing or personalization at scale, no built-in lead discovery or prospecting database, and a tool that requires significant manual effort to set up and manage sequences. Teams that have shifted toward intent-based outreach find Klenty's cold-sequence model difficult to justify."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Klenty for outbound sequences?",
    answer: "Klenty runs sequences from contact lists you provide. Cursive starts by identifying the people already visiting your website — up to 70% of anonymous B2B visitors at the person level — and then automatically triggers personalized outreach sequences based on what each visitor looked at. The emails are written by AI and reference specific pages visited, making them far more relevant than cold-list sequences. Cursive also includes direct mail as a channel, which Klenty does not."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Cursive integrate with Salesforce and HubSpot like Klenty?",
    answer: "Yes. Cursive integrates with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, and 200+ other CRM and marketing tools. Identified visitors and their engagement data are pushed to your CRM automatically, and outreach activity is logged just as it would be with Klenty — but the data coming in is richer because it includes visit behavior, intent scores, and page-level engagement rather than just sequence activity on a cold list."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the ROI difference between Cursive and Klenty?",
    answer: "The ROI comparison comes down to lead quality and conversion rate. Klenty helps you reach cold contacts more efficiently. Cursive helps you reach warm contacts — people who have already visited your site — more efficiently. Warm leads convert to booked meetings at a significantly higher rate than cold outreach. A team paying $600/month for five Klenty seats plus a separate data provider often finds that Cursive's $1,000/month flat service generates more pipeline because the underlying lead quality is fundamentally higher."

              Klenty is a solid sales engagement tool, but per-seat pricing, cold-list dependency, and the absence
              of visitor identification or AI writing are pushing teams to look for a better foundation for
              outbound. Here is what to consider instead.

              Klenty has built a loyal following among outbound sales teams for its reliable CRM integrations,
              multi-channel sequence capabilities, and straightforward pricing structure. If you use Salesforce,
              HubSpot, or Pipedrive, Klenty fits cleanly into that workflow. For teams running high-volume cold
              outbound, it delivers what it promises.
            </p>

            <p>
              But the world of B2B outbound is changing. The teams generating the most pipeline in 2025 and 2026
              are not necessarily sending the most cold emails — they are reaching out to the people who are
              already researching their solution. That requires a fundamentally different kind of tool: one that
              can identify who is visiting your website, score them by intent, and trigger personalized outreach
              automatically. Klenty does not do any of that.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this guide, we break down why teams are exploring Klenty alternatives, compare the leading options,
              and explain why <Link href="/visitor-identification">warm visitor outreach</Link> consistently outperforms
              cold sequence automation on the metrics that matter most.

            <h2>Why Sales Teams Are Looking for Klenty Alternatives</h2>

            <p>
              Klenty solves a real problem — running structured outbound sequences at scale — but it does not solve
              the harder problem underneath: finding the right people to reach out to. Here are the five pain points
              we hear most often from teams considering alternatives.
            </p>

            <div className="not-prose bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-red-200">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 5 Pain Points with Klenty</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                  <span><strong>No visitor identification or warm leads:</strong> Klenty has no way to tell you who
                  is visiting your website right now. Every prospect you contact is cold — someone you found in a
                  database or scraped from LinkedIn. This means you are missing the highest-intent prospects: the
                  ones already on your site evaluating your product.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                  <span><strong>Per-seat pricing that scales poorly:</strong> At $60–$125 per user per month, a team
                  of five pays $300–$625/month for Klenty alone — before you have paid for the contact database,
                  the email deliverability infrastructure, or any enrichment tools. The total cost of the stack
                  grows significantly with headcount.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                  <span><strong>No AI email writing:</strong> Klenty is a sequencing tool, not an AI writing tool.
                  Your reps still need to write the actual email copy. At scale, this means generic templates that
                  feel like cold outreach — because they are. There is no AI layer that personalizes based on the
                  prospect&apos;s company, role, or recent behavior.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">4.</span>
                  <span><strong>No intent data:</strong> Klenty has no visibility into what your prospects are
                  researching. Whether someone is actively evaluating your category or just matches your ICP on
                  paper, they get the same sequence. This limits your ability to prioritize or personalize based
                  on buying signals.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                  <span><strong>No direct mail channel:</strong> Modern B2B outreach increasingly uses physical
                  mail as a high-response channel in crowded inboxes. Klenty covers email, phone, LinkedIn, and
                  WhatsApp, but has no direct mail integration — leaving a channel that can break through inbox
                  noise completely off the table.</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              The common thread is that Klenty is a great sequencing engine, but it is dependent on you solving
              the lead quality problem elsewhere. The teams generating the best outbound results in 2026 are
              solving lead quality and sequencing in the same platform — starting with the warmest signals available.

                the problem Klenty leaves unsolved: finding the right people to reach out to. By
                identifying up to 70% of anonymous B2B visitors at the person level —
                names, email addresses, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles — Cursive turns your existing website

                High-intent visitors are automatically routed into AI-written outreach sequences. The emails
                reference specific content the prospect engaged with, making them feel personally relevant rather

            {/* CRM Integrations */}
            <h2>CRM Integrations: Cursive vs Klenty</h2>

            <p>
              One of Klenty&apos;s strongest selling points is its native CRM integrations — particularly with
              Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive. Sales teams rely on these integrations to sync contact activity,
              log calls and emails, and keep their CRM up to date automatically.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cursive integrates with all three of those CRMs — and 200+ additional tools — with the same two-way
              sync capability. Where Cursive adds value over Klenty&apos;s CRM connection is in the richness of the
              data it pushes through: not just sequence activity, but visitor behavior data (pages viewed, time on
              site, return visits), intent scores, and enriched firmographic information. Your Salesforce or HubSpot
              records get substantially more context about each prospect&apos;s interest level and engagement history.
            </p>

            <p>
              The practical result is that your sales team does not just know someone received three emails — they
              know that person visited the pricing page twice this week, checked the integrations page, and spent
              four minutes on the ROI calculator. That context changes how a follow-up call goes.
            </p>

            {/* ROI Comparison */}
            <h2>ROI: Klenty vs Cursive</h2>

            <p>
              The ROI question comes down to two variables: how much you are paying, and how well the leads convert.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Klenty stack cost:</strong> A team of five pays $300–$625/month for Klenty seats. Add a
              contact database or data provider ($200–$500/month), email deliverability tools ($100–$200/month),
              and an enrichment service ($100–$200/month), and the realistic total is $700–$1,500/month for a
              stack that still starts every campaign cold.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Cursive cost and lead quality:</strong> Cursive starts at $1,000/month flat and includes
              visitor identification, AI SDR outreach, multi-channel campaigns, and enrichment. More importantly,
              the leads Cursive sources from your website are warm — they have already shown buying intent.
              A warm lead that converts to a meeting 3–5x more often than a cold contact delivers substantially
              better pipeline per dollar spent, even at the same or slightly higher monthly cost.
            </p>

            <p>
              The calculation is straightforward: if Klenty contacts 500 cold leads per month and books 5 meetings
              (1% conversion), and Cursive contacts 200 warm visitors and books 10 meetings (5% conversion), Cursive
              generates 2x the pipeline at a similar cost. The pipeline math, not the software cost, is where the
              ROI difference shows up.
            </p>

            {/* Bottom Line */}
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>
              Klenty is a reliable sequencing tool with strong CRM integrations and solid multi-channel capabilities.
              If you are running a high-volume cold outbound motion and want a well-integrated platform to manage
              your sequences, Klenty delivers on that promise.
            </p>

            <p>
              But if you are looking to improve pipeline quality rather than just outbound volume — if you want to
              reach the people who are already researching your solution rather than blasting cold lists hoping
              for a 1–2% reply rate — then Klenty cannot help you with that. <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> can.
            </p>

            <p>
              The combination of <Link href="/visitor-identification">70% person-level visitor identification</Link>,{" "}
              <Link href="/what-is-b2b-intent-data">real intent data</Link>, AI-written personalized outreach, and
              direct mail creates a materially different kind of pipeline — one where you are meeting buyers where
              they already are, rather than interrupting them cold.
            </p>

            <p>
              To see how much pipeline you are currently leaving on the table, <Link href="/free-audit">request a free AI audit</Link>.
              We will identify your last 100 visitors, score them by intent, and show you exactly what a Cursive
