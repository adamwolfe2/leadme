    question: "What is Reply.io and what does it do?",
    answer: "Reply.io is a sales engagement platform that automates multi-channel outreach including email sequences, LinkedIn automation, phone calls, and WhatsApp messages. It also offers an AI SDR feature called Jason AI that can autonomously prospect, write emails, and book meetings. Teams use Reply.io to run cold outbound campaigns at scale using contact lists they build or import themselves."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are teams switching from Reply.io?",
    answer: "The most common reasons include per-seat pricing that adds up quickly for larger teams ($60-$180/user/month), no website visitor identification so you are always working cold lists rather than warm intent data, no built-in prospecting or lead discovery, the Jason AI SDR receiving mixed reviews for reply quality and personalization, and no direct mail channel. Teams that want to reach people already showing buying intent on their website find Reply.io fundamentally limited."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive's AI SDR compare to Reply.io's Jason AI?",
    answer: "The core difference is the quality of the signal each AI acts on. Reply.io's Jason AI works from cold contact lists you provide — it has no visibility into which prospects are actively researching your solution. Cursive's AI SDR acts on real intent signals: it identifies people visiting your website, scores them by engagement depth (pages viewed, return visits, time on site), and then writes personalized outreach referencing what they actually looked at. This warm-signal approach consistently outperforms cold-list automation because the AI is reaching people who are already in the market."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Cursive have multi-channel outreach like Reply.io?",
    answer: "Yes. Cursive's AI SDR runs outreach across email, LinkedIn, and direct mail. The key difference from Reply.io is that Cursive's multi-channel sequences are triggered by real visitor behavior rather than scheduled cadences applied to cold lists. When someone visits your pricing page three times in a week, Cursive's AI detects that intent signal and automatically initiates a coordinated outreach sequence across channels — rather than blasting a static cadence to everyone on a list."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Cursive cheaper than Reply.io for a team of 5?",
    answer: "For a team of 5, Reply.io costs $300–$900/month just for seats, and that does not include the Jason AI add-on, the contact database you need to import, or any visitor identification capability. Cursive starts at $1,000/month as a flat done-for-you service that includes visitor identification, AI outreach across email/LinkedIn/direct mail, and contact enrichment — all without per-seat charges. For most teams of 5 or more, Cursive delivers significantly more pipeline per dollar spent."

            <p>
              Reply.io has been a go-to sales engagement platform for outbound teams since its launch. The multi-channel
              sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and the Jason AI SDR feature have helped plenty of teams run campaigns at
              scale. But as <Link href="/what-is-ai-sdr">AI SDR technology</Link> matures and <Link href="/visitor-identification">website visitor identification</Link> becomes
              mainstream, a growing number of teams are questioning whether Reply.io is still the right foundation for
              their outbound motion.
            </p>

            <p>
              The core tension is this: Reply.io is built around cold lists. You bring the contacts, Reply.io helps you
              reach them. But modern outbound is increasingly about working warm signals — identifying people who are
              already researching your solution and reaching them while intent is high. That is a fundamentally different
              motion, and it requires fundamentally different tooling.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this guide, we break down why teams are leaving Reply.io, compare the top alternatives, and explain
              how a warm-signal approach typically outperforms cold-sequence automation by a wide margin.

            <h2>Why Teams Are Looking for Reply.io Alternatives</h2>

            <p>
              Reply.io is a capable tool and the team behind it has built real features. But after speaking with
              hundreds of outbound teams throughout 2025 and into 2026, we hear the same complaints repeatedly.
              Here are the five most common.
            </p>

            <div className="not-prose bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-red-200">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 5 Pain Points with Reply.io</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                  <span><strong>Per-seat pricing adds up fast:</strong> At $60–$180 per user per month, a team of five
                  is paying $300–$900/month before you have added the Jason AI SDR add-on, bought a contact list,
                  or paid for email deliverability tools. The effective cost of a working outbound stack is
                  significantly higher than the headline price.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                  <span><strong>Cold list dependency — no warm leads:</strong> Reply.io has no way to identify who
                  is already visiting your website. Every campaign starts from scratch with a cold list you have
                  to build or buy elsewhere. This misses the highest-intent prospects — the ones already
                  researching your solution right now.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                  <span><strong>Jason AI quality is inconsistent:</strong> The Jason AI SDR feature has received mixed
                  feedback. Users report that the emails it generates often feel templated rather than truly
                  personalized, and that reply rates are lower than expected for an AI-driven tool. Without real
                  intent signals to act on, even the best AI copy is working against a cold, skeptical audience.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">4.</span>
                  <span><strong>No intent data or buyer signals:</strong> Reply.io has no visibility into what your
                  prospects are researching, which pages of your site they have visited, or how engaged they are.
                  This means every lead gets essentially the same generic sequence, regardless of where they are
                  in the buying process.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                  <span><strong>No direct mail channel:</strong> In a world where email inboxes are increasingly
                  crowded and LinkedIn connection rates are dropping, direct mail is proving to be a high-impact
                  differentiator. Reply.io covers email, LinkedIn, and phone, but has no physical mail capability —
                  leaving a proven channel unused.</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              These are not edge cases. They represent structural limitations in how Reply.io was designed: as a
              sequencing tool that assumes you already have the contacts and just need a way to reach them. The
              shift teams are making is toward platforms that solve the lead discovery and intent problem first,
              then automate outreach on top of that foundation.
            </p>

                and routes them into the right outreach sequence automatically. Emails written by the AI reference
                specific pages the prospect visited, making them feel personal rather than templated. Outreach goes
                across email, LinkedIn, and <Link href="/direct-mail" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">direct mail</Link>,
                coordinated to hit the prospect across channels while intent is still hot.

            {/* How Cursive's AI SDR Differs */}
            <h2>Cursive AI SDR vs Reply.io Jason AI: What Actually Drives Results</h2>

            <p>
              Both Cursive and Reply.io offer AI SDR capabilities, but the underlying mechanism is completely different.
              Understanding that difference explains why response rates vary so dramatically.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Reply.io Jason AI</strong> receives a contact list and a goal, then autonomously writes and
              sends emails, follows up, and tries to book meetings. The limitation is that Jason has no visibility
              into whether a given prospect is actually in-market. It is essentially a sophisticated cold emailer
              that can write its own copy.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Cursive&apos;s AI SDR</strong> starts with a signal: someone visited your pricing page today. Or
              someone from a 200-person SaaS company visited your integrations page four times this week. The AI
              knows exactly what that person looked at, how engaged they were, and what their company looks like.
              It writes an email that says &quot;I noticed you were looking at how we integrate with HubSpot — we helped
              [similar company] cut their data entry by 60%&quot; rather than a generic pitch that could apply to anyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              The result is a fundamentally different conversation rate. When you reach someone who is already
              researching a solution like yours, with a message that demonstrates you understand what they were
              looking at, the response rate is typically 3–5x higher than cold outreach to an equivalent list.
            </p>

            {/* Pricing Comparison */}
            <h2>Pricing: Reply.io vs Cursive</h2>

            <p>
              Reply.io charges per seat, with plans ranging from $60 to $180 per user per month. For a team of five,
              you are at $300–$900/month before factoring in the Jason AI SDR add-on, which is priced separately,
              or any contact database costs. A realistic Reply.io stack for a mid-market team often exceeds $1,500/month.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cursive starts at <Link href="/pricing">$1,000/month flat</Link> for the full done-for-you service: visitor
              identification, AI SDR outreach, email, LinkedIn, direct mail, and contact enrichment — all included.
              No per-seat charges, no add-ons required. As your team grows from 5 to 10 to 20 people, the Cursive
              price does not change. The Reply.io bill does.
            </p>

            <p>
              The comparison is not just about raw price. It is about what you get for the money. Reply.io gives you
              a sequencing tool and an AI SDR working cold lists. Cursive gives you the leads themselves — warm,
              intent-verified visitors — plus the AI outreach to convert them. The pipeline quality difference is
              significant.
            </p>

            {/* The Bottom Line */}
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>
              Reply.io is a capable sales engagement platform for teams that are comfortable managing contact lists,
              building sequences manually, and paying per seat as they grow. If that describes your team and you are
              happy with the results, it is not a bad tool.
            </p>

            <p>
              But if you want to stop working cold lists and start reaching buyers who are already raising their hand
              on your website, Reply.io cannot help you with that. <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> can.

              <Link href="/what-is-b2b-intent-data">real intent data</Link>, and an AI SDR that writes personalized
              outreach based on what each prospect actually viewed is a materially different kind of outbound — one
              that converts at a higher rate with less manual effort.
