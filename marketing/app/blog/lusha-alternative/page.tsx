    question: "What is Lusha and what does it do?",
    answer: "Lusha is a B2B contact data provider that helps sales teams find email addresses and direct dial phone numbers for business contacts. It is best known for its Chrome extension, which allows sales reps to instantly pull contact information for people they find on LinkedIn or company websites. Lusha has a database of 100M+ business profiles and is widely used by SDRs for cold outreach prospecting."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are sales teams looking for Lusha alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons sales teams seek Lusha alternatives include: credit limits that restrict high-volume prospecting, per-user pricing that becomes expensive for teams, no website visitor identification, no intent data to prioritize active buyers, no built-in outreach automation, and limited capabilities beyond basic contact lookup. Teams scaling their outbound motion often find Lusha too narrow for their full workflow needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Lusha free? What are its limitations?",
    answer: "Lusha offers a free tier with 50 credits per month, which is enough for testing but insufficient for active prospecting. Paid plans start at $29/user/month for 480 credits, scaling to $79/user/month for 960 credits. Team plans start at $129/user/month. The main limitations of the free plan are the low credit count, no bulk export, and no team collaboration features. Even paid plans cap credits, which becomes a bottleneck for high-volume SDR teams."
  },
  {
    question: "What Lusha alternative includes visitor identification?",
    answer: "Cursive is the top Lusha alternative that includes website visitor identification. While Lusha only provides contact data for prospects you manually search, Cursive installs a lightweight pixel on your website and identifies up to 70% of your anonymous visitors in real time, matching them to its database of 280M US consumer and 140M+ business profiles. This means you get warm leads from people already showing interest in your product, a fundamentally different and higher-intent workflow than Lusha's manual contact lookup."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Lusha for B2B prospecting?",
    answer: "Cursive goes significantly further than Lusha. Where Lusha focuses on helping you find contact info for specific people you already know you want to reach, Cursive helps you discover who you should be reaching in the first place, through visitor identification (70% person-level match rate), intent signals (60B+ behaviors & URLs scanned weekly across 30,000+ categories), and a database of 280M US consumer and 140M+ business profiles. Cursive also includes an AI SDR that automates personalized outreach across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail, while Lusha provides data only."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best Lusha alternative for agencies?",
    answer: "For agencies managing outbound for multiple clients, Cursive is the best Lusha alternative because it offers a self-serve marketplace at leads.meetcursive.com where you can purchase leads at $0.60 per lead with no monthly commitment. This per-lead pricing model is much more flexible than Lusha's per-user, per-credit model when you are managing variable volume across multiple client accounts. Cursive also supports multi-tenant workflows with 200+ CRM integrations."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a Lusha alternative for automated outreach?",
    answer: "Yes, Cursive includes built-in AI-powered outreach automation as part of the platform. Unlike Lusha which is purely a data tool requiring you to use separate sequencing software, Cursive combines the data layer with an AI SDR that automatically sends personalized emails, LinkedIn connection requests and messages, SMS messages, and direct mail. The outreach is triggered by visitor behavior and intent signals, so contacts are reached at the right moment with contextually relevant messaging."

                Lusha is great for quick contact lookups, but credit limits, per-user pricing, and a lack of visitor
                identification or outreach automation leave many teams searching for a more complete solution. Here are
                the seven best Lusha alternatives.

                Lusha built a strong reputation as a B2B contact data tool, particularly for sales reps who need quick
                access to direct dial phone numbers and verified email addresses directly from their browser. The Chrome
                extension made it genuinely useful for prospecting on LinkedIn, and the 100M+ profile database gave it
                reasonable coverage.
              </p>

              <p>
                But as sales teams grow and outbound motions mature, Lusha&apos;s limitations become real friction points.
                The per-user, per-credit pricing model that seems affordable for one rep quickly balloons for a team of ten.
                The free plan&apos;s 50 credits per month runs out in hours for any active prospector. And perhaps most
                critically, Lusha tells you nothing about which prospects are actually in buying mode right now.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this guide, we compare seven Lusha alternatives across data quality, visitor identification, intent data,
                outreach automation, pricing, and overall value. Whether you are replacing Lusha entirely or supplementing
                it with something more powerful, this comparison will help you make the right call.

              <h2>Why Sales Teams Are Moving Away from Lusha</h2>

              <p>
                Lusha is not a bad tool. For an individual SDR doing manual prospecting, it does its job. But several
                limitations emerge quickly once you try to scale.
              </p>

              <div className="not-prose bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-red-200">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 5 Pain Points with Lusha</h3>
                <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                    <span><strong>Credit limits throttle high-volume teams:</strong> Even the most expensive individual
                    plan ($79/mo) caps you at 960 credits per month. For an active SDR making 50+ prospecting attempts per
                    day, that budget runs out in roughly three weeks. Teams have to choose between slowing down or paying
                    for additional credits, which quickly multiplies the cost.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                    <span><strong>Per-user pricing compounds at scale:</strong> At $29-$79 per user per month, a 10-person
                    SDR team pays $290-$790 per month just for contact lookups. When you add the sequencing tools, LinkedIn
                    automation, and CRM you still need on top, Lusha becomes an expensive line item in an increasingly
                    expensive stack.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                    <span><strong>No visibility into who is already interested:</strong> Lusha can only help you find
                    contact info for people you already know you want to reach. It cannot tell you which companies and
                    individuals are visiting your website right now and showing buying intent. That warm traffic remains
                    completely invisible, and those are often your highest-converting prospects.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">4.</span>
                    <span><strong>No intent data to prioritize outreach:</strong> Lusha is a lookup tool with no signals
                    about who is actually in buying mode. Without intent data, you are prospecting blind, reaching out to
                    contacts based on fit criteria alone rather than combining fit with timing. The result is lower
                    response rates and more wasted effort.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                    <span><strong>No outreach automation:</strong> After looking up a contact in Lusha, you still need to
                    copy their information into a separate sequencing tool, write your emails, set up LinkedIn tasks, and
                    track responses manually across multiple platforms. Lusha is the first step in a multi-tool workflow
                    that adds friction at every stage.</span>

              </div>

              <p>
                These limitations push teams toward integrated platforms that combine data quality with the intelligence
                and automation needed to run efficient outbound at scale. Let us look at the seven best options.

                  based on intent signals and visitor behavior automatically. The <Link href="/intent-audiences" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">intent audience engine</Link> identifies
                  companies actively researching solutions like yours, and the visitor identification pixel reveals which of
                  your existing website visitors are ready to talk. For agencies and teams managing multiple outbound campaigns,
                  the <Link href="/marketplace" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">self-serve marketplace</Link> at leads.meetcursive.com
                  offers a flexible $0.60/lead model with no monthly commitment.

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Apollo is the most direct Lusha competitor at a similar or lower
                  price point, but with a larger database (275M+ contacts) and built-in sequencing. Where Lusha is purely
                  a contact lookup tool, Apollo includes email sequences, LinkedIn automation, a Chrome extension, and a
                  robust CRM integration layer. The free tier is generous (10,000 records per month) and the jump to paid
                  plans is reasonable. For teams that feel constrained by Lusha&apos;s credit system and want sequencing
                  included, Apollo is a logical step up.

                  database available, with intent data (via Bombora), website visitor identification (WebSights), and sales
                  engagement (Engage). For enterprise organizations with dedicated revenue operations teams and six-figure
                  budgets, ZoomInfo is the most feature-complete option. For most companies comparing Lusha alternatives,
                  it is likely overbuilt and overpriced.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Hunter.io takes a different approach than Lusha. Instead of
                  looking up specific contact records, Hunter specializes in finding email addresses by domain. You input a
                  company domain and it returns the email format and known contacts associated with that domain. It also
                  includes email verification, basic outreach campaign tools, and a Chrome extension. For use cases like
                  PR outreach, link building, or finding generic business email addresses, Hunter is cost-effective. For
                  B2B sales prospecting that requires direct contact records, it is more limited than Lusha.

              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                Lusha is a solid contact lookup tool for individual reps doing manual prospecting, but it was designed
                for a simpler era of outbound. In 2026, the most efficient B2B revenue teams do not start their prospecting
                by manually searching for contacts. They start by identifying who is already showing intent, whether that
                means visiting your website, consuming competitor content, or actively researching your category.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you find yourself spending hours manually looking up contacts in Lusha while your website traffic
                goes unidentified and your competitors are reaching active buyers first, the answer is not a better
                lookup tool. It is a fundamentally different approach to building pipeline.
              </p>
