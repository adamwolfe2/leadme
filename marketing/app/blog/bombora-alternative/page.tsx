    question: "What is Bombora and what does it do?",
    answer: "Bombora is a B2B intent data provider best known for its 'Company Surge' product, which tracks intent signals from a cooperative network of 5,000+ B2B media and publisher sites. It monitors which companies are actively researching topics related to your product category and surfaces accounts that are showing elevated research activity — called 'surging' — so sales and marketing teams can prioritize outreach to in-market buyers. Bombora primarily provides company-level intent data sold through an enterprise sales process."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are companies looking for Bombora alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons include the extremely high cost ($25,000–$150,000/year, enterprise-only), company-level signals only (no person-level identification of who is actually doing the research), complex multi-month implementation and contract processes, no self-serve option for smaller teams, no built-in visitor identification for your own website, and no outreach automation. Many teams find they pay enterprise prices for data they cannot immediately act on without additional tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Bombora for intent data?",
    answer: "Bombora delivers third-party intent signals showing which companies are researching topics across the broader web. Cursive delivers first-party intent signals by identifying the specific people visiting your own website — the warmest possible signal because these are prospects already interested enough in your product to come directly to you. Cursive identifies individuals (not just companies) at up to 70% match rates, and automatically triggers AI-powered outreach across email, LinkedIn, and direct mail. Where Bombora tells you which accounts to cold-call, Cursive shows you warm prospects already on your site and automates the follow-up."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Cursive cheaper than Bombora?",
    answer: "Significantly cheaper. Bombora's Company Surge product starts at approximately $25,000/year and scales to $150,000+/year for enterprise plans, sold through a lengthy sales process with 6+ month contracts. Cursive starts at $1,000/month ($12,000/year) and is available self-serve — no sales call required to get started. Cursive's pricing also includes visitor identification, AI SDR outreach automation, multi-channel sequences, and lead scoring all in one platform, while Bombora delivers only intent data, requiring additional tools for activation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Cursive replace Bombora for B2B prospecting?",
    answer: "For most B2B teams, yes. Cursive covers the highest-value use case — identifying and automatically engaging warm prospects who are already on your website — at a fraction of the cost. Teams that relied on Bombora's third-party intent data to find in-market accounts often find that Cursive's first-party visitor identification delivers better conversion rates because the signals are warmer and more specific. Cursive also includes the outreach automation that Bombora lacks, eliminating the need for additional tools. For teams that specifically need broad third-party intent signals across many topic categories, combining Cursive with a lighter-weight intent data tool may make sense."

                Bombora built the category of third-party B2B intent data. Its cooperative publisher network spanning 5,000+
                B2B media sites gives revenue teams a unique signal: which companies across the entire web are actively
                researching topics related to what you sell. In theory, that is powerful. In practice, many teams run into
                the same set of problems — a price tag that starts at $25,000/year, company-level signals that require
                additional research to find the actual buyer, no way to identify visitors to your own site, and no built-in
                mechanism to actually do anything with the data.
              </p>

              <p>
                After evaluating intent data platforms with hundreds of B2B revenue teams throughout 2025 and into 2026,
                we heard consistent frustration: Bombora tells you a company is &quot;surging&quot; on a topic, but you still
                need to figure out who at that company to contact, what to say, and how to reach them. For most teams,
                that gap consumes the ROI.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this guide, we compare the best Bombora alternatives across what matters most: signal quality,
                person-level vs. company-level identification, outreach activation, self-serve availability, and
                total cost of ownership. Whether you want to replace Bombora entirely or find a complementary
                tool that fills its gaps, this comparison will help you decide.

              <h2>Why Companies Are Looking for Bombora Alternatives</h2>

              <p>
                Bombora is genuinely good at what it does: tracking topic-level research activity across a large
                publisher cooperative. But five structural limitations drive most companies to seek alternatives
                or complements.

                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                    <span><strong>Enterprise-only pricing ($25k–$150k/year):</strong> Bombora has no self-serve option and
                    no startup-friendly tier. Annual contracts start at $25,000 and require a full enterprise sales
                    cycle. For most companies under $10M ARR, Bombora is simply not accessible.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                    <span><strong>Company-level only — no person-level signals:</strong> Bombora tells you that Acme Corp
                    is surging on &quot;CRM software&quot; but not which of their 500 employees is doing the research. You
                    still need to guess who the buyer is and cold-outreach into the company, which limits conversion rates.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                    <span><strong>No visitor identification for your own site:</strong> Bombora&apos;s signals come from activity
                    across third-party publisher sites. It cannot tell you which companies or individuals are visiting
                    your own website — the warmest signal of all. You need a separate tool for that.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">4.</span>
                    <span><strong>No outreach automation — data without activation:</strong> Bombora delivers intent
                    data but provides no mechanism to act on it. You still need a separate sequencing tool, LinkedIn
                    automation, and CRM workflows to actually reach the surging accounts. Many teams find the data
                    sits unused because the activation gap is too large.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                    <span><strong>6+ month contracts with complex setup:</strong> Bombora requires a lengthy implementation,
                    integration with your MAP or CRM, and a 6+ month contract commitment. For teams that want to move
                    fast and test ROI before committing, the onboarding process is a significant barrier.</span>

                  active buying cycle. It overlays predictive scoring on top of intent signals, CRM data, and
                  technographic data to surface &quot;in-market&quot; accounts with a confidence score. For large enterprise
                  go-to-market teams running complex ABM programs, 6sense&apos;s orchestration capabilities are comprehensive.
                  However, it shares many of Bombora&apos;s core limitations — company-level only, enterprise pricing, and

                  <strong>What makes it different:</strong> TechTarget runs a large network of technology-focused
                  B2B publisher sites (including TechTarget.com, SearchSecurity, SearchCRM, etc.). Priority Engine
                  surfaces companies — and in some cases individual contacts — actively consuming content about
                  specific technology topics on that network. Because TechTarget&apos;s audience is explicitly technology
                  buyers, the signals tend to be more relevant for technology vendors than Bombora&apos;s broader
                  publisher network.

                  <strong>Important update:</strong> Clearbit, which offered first-party visitor identification
                  via Clearbit Reveal, was acquired by HubSpot and is no longer available as a standalone product.
                  If you are a HubSpot customer on an enterprise plan, some Clearbit features are included. For
                  everyone else, you will need an alternative. Clearbit Reveal provided company-level identification
                  of your own website visitors — a different signal from Bombora&apos;s third-party intent, but a useful
                  complement. For a full comparison of what replaced Clearbit, see our{" "}

              <h2>Pricing Comparison: Bombora vs. Alternatives</h2>

              <p>
                Cost is the most frequently cited reason teams look for Bombora alternatives. Here is a
                realistic total cost of ownership comparison for a mid-market B2B company.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Bombora + required activation tools:</strong> Bombora Company Surge ($25,000–$50,000/yr)
                + visitor ID tool ($5,000–$12,000/yr) + email sequencing tool ($2,400/yr) + LinkedIn automation
                ($1,800/yr) = $34,200–$65,800/yr for a fragmented stack that still requires manual work to connect
                the dots from intent signal to outreach.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Cursive all-in-one:</strong> Starting at $1,000/month ($12,000/year), you get first-party
                visitor identification at the person level, AI SDR automation, multi-channel outreach (email,
                LinkedIn, <Link href="/direct-mail">direct mail</Link>), intent scoring, and{" "}
                <Link href="/what-is-lead-enrichment">lead enrichment</Link> — all in a single platform with
                no enterprise sales process required. Visit our <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link> for details.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>The trade-off:</strong> Bombora and third-party intent tools cover research activity happening
                across the broader web, while Cursive focuses exclusively on your own website&apos;s traffic.
                For most teams, the warm first-party signals Cursive provides convert at significantly higher rates
                than cold outreach to &quot;surging&quot; third-party accounts — at 5-10% of the cost.
              </p>

              {/* Bottom Line */}
              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>
                Bombora built a genuine category and has real value for large enterprise GTM teams with the
                budget and operational maturity to activate third-party intent signals at scale. But its
                $25,000+ price floor, company-level-only data, complex implementation, and lack of outreach
                automation make it inaccessible or ineffective for the majority of B2B companies.
              </p>

              <p>
                For teams that want to catch in-market buyers without enterprise pricing or a 6-month
                implementation, the strongest alternative is flipping the model: instead of chasing third-party
                signals across the web, identify and immediately engage the warm prospects already visiting
                your site. That is what{" "}
                <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> is built to do — person-level
                identification, <Link href="/intent-audiences">intent scoring</Link>, and AI-powered outreach in one
                platform at $1,000/month.

              <p>
                <strong>Adam Wolfe</strong> is the founder of Cursive. After years of helping B2B companies navigate
                expensive intent data platforms without a clear path from signal to pipeline, he built Cursive to
                solve the problem with first-party visitor identification and built-in AI outreach automation —
                all in a single self-serve platform.

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">What is Bombora and what does it do?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Bombora is a B2B intent data provider best known for its Company Surge product, which tracks intent signals from a cooperative network of 5,000+ B2B media and publisher sites. It monitors which companies are actively researching topics related to your product category and surfaces accounts showing elevated research activity, sold through enterprise contracts starting at $25,000/year.</p>

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Why are companies looking for Bombora alternatives?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Key reasons: Extremely high cost ($25,000–$150,000/year, enterprise-only), company-level signals only (no person identification), no self-serve option, no visitor identification for your own website, no built-in outreach automation, and 6+ month contracts with complex setup requirements.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">How does Cursive compare to Bombora for intent data?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Bombora delivers third-party intent signals from publisher sites (company-level). Cursive delivers first-party intent signals by identifying specific people visiting your website — the warmest possible signal. Cursive identifies individuals at ~70% match rates and automatically triggers AI-powered outreach across email, LinkedIn, and direct mail. Where Bombora tells you which accounts to cold-call, Cursive shows warm prospects already on your site and automates follow-up.</p>

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Is Cursive cheaper than Bombora?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Significantly cheaper. Bombora starts at $25,000/year (no self-serve, 6+ month contracts). Cursive starts at $1,000/month ($12,000/year), self-serve with no minimum contract. Cursive also includes visitor identification, AI SDR automation, multi-channel outreach, and lead scoring in one platform — vs. Bombora delivering only intent data with no activation mechanism.</p>

              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Can Cursive replace Bombora for B2B prospecting?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">For most B2B teams, yes. Cursive covers the highest-value use case — identifying and automatically engaging warm prospects already on your website — at a fraction of the cost. Teams relying on Bombora's third-party intent to find in-market accounts often find Cursive delivers better conversion rates because first-party signals are warmer and more specific. Cursive also includes the outreach automation Bombora lacks, eliminating need for additional tools.</p>
