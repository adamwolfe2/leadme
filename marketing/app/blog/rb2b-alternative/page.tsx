  {
    question: "What is RB2B and what does it do?",
    answer: "RB2B is a website visitor identification tool that reveals the identities of anonymous B2B website visitors. It uses IP-based identification and data enrichment to match visitor IP addresses to company and individual contact records, allowing sales teams to follow up with people who visited their site but never filled out a form."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are companies looking for RB2B alternatives?",
    answer: "The most common reasons include lower-than-expected match rates (typically 50-60% for companies, lower for individuals), lack of built-in outreach automation requiring additional tools, no native intent data capabilities, single-channel focus limited to email, and costs that add up quickly when you need to bolt on additional tools for a complete workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "What match rate should I expect from visitor identification tools?",
    answer: "Match rates vary significantly between tools. RB2B typically delivers 50-60% company-level match rates. Cursive achieves up to 70% person-level match rates by combining multiple identification methods including IP intelligence, device fingerprinting, and behavioral signals. The best tools combine several data sources to maximize identification accuracy."
  },
  {
    question: "Can visitor identification tools identify individual people or just companies?",
    answer: "Most tools like Leadfeeder and VisitorQueue only identify companies visiting your site. RB2B and Cursive go further by identifying individual contacts. Cursive provides person-level identification with names, email addresses, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles, giving your sales team specific people to contact rather than generic company names."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Cursive a good RB2B alternative?",
    answer: "Yes, Cursive is the top-rated RB2B alternative for teams that want higher match rates and built-in automation. Unlike RB2B which focuses solely on identification, Cursive combines 70% person-level match rates with an AI SDR that automates personalized outreach across email, LinkedIn, and direct mail, eliminating the need for multiple disconnected tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to switch from RB2B to an alternative?",
    answer: "Switching costs are minimal for most tools. Cursive offers a free audit to show you exactly what you are missing, and setup takes about 5 minutes with a simple pixel installation. Most teams see results within the first 24 hours. Pricing starts at $1,000 per month for Cursive, which includes visitor identification, AI outreach, and intent data, compared to paying separately for each capability with RB2B plus additional tools."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate tools for visitor identification and outreach?",
    answer: "With RB2B, yes. You will need additional tools for email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and CRM integration. With Cursive, no. The platform includes built-in AI SDR capabilities that handle personalized outreach across multiple channels automatically, based on visitor behavior and intent signals. This consolidation saves both money and integration headaches."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best free RB2B alternative?",
    answer: "Leadfeeder offers a limited free plan, but it only provides company-level identification with basic analytics. For person-level identification, most tools require a paid plan. Cursive offers a free AI audit that shows you exactly which visitors you are missing and what pipeline you could generate, so you can evaluate ROI before committing."

              RB2B popularized website visitor identification for B2B teams, but lower match rates, missing outreach automation,
              and limited intent data have many companies searching for something better. Here are the top alternatives.

              If you have been using RB2B for <Link href="/visitor-identification">website visitor identification</Link>, you already know
              the value of unmasking anonymous traffic. Knowing which companies and people are browsing your site is a game-changer
              for B2B sales teams. But you have probably also noticed the limitations: match rates that plateau around 50-60%, no
              built-in way to actually reach out to those visitors, and a growing stack of tools needed to turn identification data
              into real pipeline.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are not alone. After speaking with hundreds of B2B revenue teams throughout 2025 and into 2026, we consistently
              heard the same frustrations with RB2B. The tool does one thing well, but modern go-to-market teams need more than
              just visitor identification. They need a complete workflow that goes from identification to outreach to booked meetings.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this guide, we compare seven RB2B alternatives across the dimensions that matter most: match rates,
              outreach automation, <Link href="/what-is-b2b-intent-data">intent data</Link>, pricing, and multi-channel capabilities.
              Whether you are looking to replace RB2B entirely or supplement it, this comparison will help you find the right fit.

            <h2>Why Companies Are Looking for RB2B Alternatives</h2>

            <p>
              RB2B deserves credit for making website visitor identification accessible to smaller B2B teams. But as
              companies scale their go-to-market motions, five specific pain points drive them to seek alternatives.
            </p>

            <div className="not-prose bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-red-200">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Top 5 Pain Points with RB2B</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm">
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">1.</span>
                  <span><strong>Lower match rates (50-60%):</strong> RB2B relies primarily on IP-based identification, which
                  misses a significant portion of your traffic. Remote workers, mobile visitors, and VPN users often go
                  unidentified, leaving pipeline on the table. Teams report that nearly half their visitors remain anonymous.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">2.</span>
                  <span><strong>No built-in outreach automation:</strong> RB2B tells you who visited your site, but then what?
                  You need separate tools for email sequencing, LinkedIn outreach, and CRM management. This creates data silos,
                  integration overhead, and delays between identification and first touch.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">3.</span>
                  <span><strong>No intent data or scoring:</strong> Knowing someone visited your site is helpful, but knowing
                  they visited your pricing page three times in a week is actionable. RB2B lacks native intent signal tracking,
                  so you cannot prioritize visitors by buying intent or engagement depth.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">4.</span>
                  <span><strong>Single-channel focus:</strong> RB2B is primarily an email-oriented tool. Modern B2B buyers
                  engage across multiple channels. Without native support for LinkedIn, direct mail, or retargeting, you
                  are limited to one touchpoint in an increasingly multi-touch buying process.</span>
                </li>
                <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
                  <span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg leading-none mt-0.5">5.</span>
                  <span><strong>Total cost of ownership adds up:</strong> While RB2B&apos;s base price seems affordable, the real
                  cost includes email sequencing tools ($100-300/mo), LinkedIn automation ($100-200/mo), enrichment services
                  ($200+/mo), and CRM connectors. The total stack often exceeds $1,000/mo for capabilities that integrated
                  alternatives include out of the box.</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              These limitations are not dealbreakers for every team, especially those just getting started with visitor identification.
              But for growth-stage companies that need to convert more traffic into pipeline efficiently, the gaps become
              significant. Let us look at the alternatives that address these challenges.

                live conversations, this combination can be powerful. The platform identifies visiting companies and individuals,
                then triggers chat prompts based on visitor profile and behavior. It is a different approach than RB2B&apos;s
                post-visit identification model.

                identification data on top of your existing analytics without adding a separate tracking script. However, it
                only identifies companies, not individuals, and match rates tend to sit around 30-40%.

                <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Albacross is a European-based visitor identification platform built
                with GDPR compliance as a foundational principle. It identifies companies visiting your website and provides
                intent signals based on visit behavior, all while maintaining strict European data privacy standards. The
                platform integrates with popular CRMs and marketing automation tools, and it offers display advertising
                retargeting to re-engage identified accounts. For companies selling into European markets, Albacross&apos;s
                compliance-first approach can be a significant advantage over US-based alternatives.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>What makes it different:</strong> Koala focuses on combining website visitor identification with
                product usage data, making it particularly useful for PLG companies. It tracks both marketing site visits
                and in-app behavior, giving sales teams a unified view of how prospects engage across the entire customer
                journey. The intent scoring model factors in product trial activity, feature usage, and website behavior to
                identify the most sales-ready accounts. If you run a freemium or free trial model, Koala&apos;s approach can
                surface high-value conversion opportunities that pure visitor ID tools miss.

            {/* Pricing Comparison */}
            <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

            <p>
              One of the biggest reasons teams explore RB2B alternatives is total cost of ownership. When you factor in the
              additional tools you need alongside RB2B, the picture changes dramatically. Here is a realistic cost comparison
              for a mid-market B2B company with 10,000 monthly visitors.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>RB2B + required add-ons:</strong> RB2B base ($300/mo) + email sequencing tool ($200/mo) + LinkedIn automation ($150/mo)
              + enrichment service ($200/mo) = approximately $850/mo for a fragmented stack with no unified workflow.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Cursive all-in-one:</strong> Starting at $1,000/mo, you get visitor identification, AI SDR, multi-channel outreach,
              intent data, and <Link href="/what-is-lead-enrichment">lead enrichment</Link> in a single platform. No integrations to manage, no data
              silos, and typically higher conversion rates due to faster follow-up. Visit our <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link> for
              detailed plan breakdowns.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Budget option:</strong> VisitorQueue ($39/mo) or Leadfeeder ($139/mo) for basic company identification. You will
              still need outreach tools on top, but for teams just validating the concept, these offer a low-risk entry point.
            </p>

            {/* Migration Guide */}
            <h2>How to Migrate from RB2B (Step-by-Step)</h2>

            <p>
              Switching from RB2B to a new visitor identification platform does not have to be disruptive. Here is a
              six-step migration plan that most teams complete in under a week.

                  <div>
                    <strong>Run both tools in parallel for 2 weeks.</strong> Compare match rates, data quality, and conversion
                    metrics side by side. This overlap period lets you validate the new tool&apos;s performance before fully committing.

                  <div>
                    <strong>Remove RB2B and consolidate.</strong> Once you have confirmed the new tool meets or exceeds your
                    benchmarks, remove the RB2B script and cancel the subscription along with any redundant add-on tools.
                    Clean up your CRM integrations and train your team on the new workflow.

            <p>
              The entire process typically takes 2-3 weeks, with most teams seeing improved results within the first
              week of running both tools in parallel. If you want help evaluating what you are

            {/* Bottom Line */}
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>
              RB2B opened the door to <Link href="/what-is-website-visitor-identification">website visitor identification</Link> for
              many B2B teams, and it still works well as a basic identification tool. But the market has evolved rapidly. In 2026,
              the best visitor identification tools do not just tell you who visited. They help you do something about it.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you need the highest match rates with built-in multi-channel outreach,{" "}
              <Link href="/">Cursive</Link> is the clear choice. If you want real-time chat engagement,
              Warmly is worth evaluating. If you are on a tight budget and just need company-level data, Leadfeeder or
              VisitorQueue will get you started.
            </p>

            <p>
              For companies serious about turning website traffic into pipeline, the winning strategy is to combine
              high match rates with automated, personalized outreach triggered
              by <Link href="/what-is-b2b-intent-data">intent signals</Link>. That is exactly what we built
              Cursive to do. Explore our <Link href="/platform">full platform</Link> to see how the pieces fit together,

                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">What is RB2B and what does it do?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">RB2B is a website visitor identification tool that reveals identities of anonymous B2B website visitors using IP-based identification and data enrichment to match visitor IP addresses to company and individual contact records.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Why are companies looking for RB2B alternatives?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Lower-than-expected match rates (50-60% for companies, lower for individuals), lack of built-in outreach automation requiring additional tools, no native intent data capabilities, single-channel focus limited to email, and costs that add up quickly when bolting on additional tools.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">What match rate should I expect from visitor identification tools?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Match rates vary significantly. RB2B typically delivers 50-60% company-level. Cursive achieves up to 70% person-level match rates by combining multiple identification methods including IP intelligence, device fingerprinting, and behavioral signals.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Can visitor identification tools identify individual people or just companies?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Most tools like Leadfeeder and VisitorQueue only identify companies. RB2B and Cursive go further by identifying individual contacts. Cursive provides person-level identification with names, email addresses, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Is Cursive a good RB2B alternative?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes, Cursive is the top-rated RB2B alternative for teams wanting higher match rates and built-in automation. Unlike RB2B which focuses solely on identification, Cursive combines 70% person-level match rates with an AI SDR that automates personalized outreach across email, LinkedIn, and direct mail.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">How much does it cost to switch from RB2B to an alternative?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Switching costs are minimal. Cursive offers a free audit to show what you're missing, and setup takes about 5 minutes with simple pixel installation. Most teams see results within first 24 hours. Pricing starts at $1,000/mo including visitor identification, AI outreach, and intent data.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Do I need separate tools for visitor identification and outreach?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">With RB2B, yes - you need additional tools for email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and CRM integration. With Cursive, no - the platform includes built-in AI SDR capabilities that handle personalized outreach across multiple channels automatically based on visitor behavior and intent signals.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">What is the best free RB2B alternative?</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Leadfeeder offers a limited free plan, but it only provides company-level identification with basic analytics. For person-level identification, most tools require a paid plan. Cursive offers a free AI audit that shows exactly which visitors you're missing and what pipeline you could generate.</p>
