# Buyer Intent-Based Audience Segmentation: How to Target Ready-to-Buy Prospects

Getting the right message to the right person doesn't have to feel like guesswork.

When you pay attention to what people actually do—what they click, read, or search—you can start grouping your audiences in much smarter ways.

These actions give you a window into what matters to them right now, not just what they said a week ago.

That's where audience segmentation strategies based on buyer intent come in. You're not categorizing people by age or job titles anymore. You're looking at how they behave and what those behaviors say about their willingness to engage or buy.

By focusing on intent, you don't waste time sending marketing that doesn't match. Instead, you speak more clearly and helpfully, leading to better conversations, fewer missed chances, and stronger outcomes.

## What Buyer Intent Really Means

Buyer intent is about showing, not telling. It's the actions a person takes that suggest they're thinking about making a purchase or choosing a service.

People tell you plenty without saying a word when they visit specific pages or engage with certain content.

**Examples of intent signals:**

- Spending time on pricing pages → Comparing options seriously
- Checking product features or FAQ → Deeper level of interest
- Downloading a guide or case study → Want more before deciding

Sometimes people are just browsing, and that's fine. But high-intent behavior stands out when it's tied to clear action.

**Visiting once doesn't say much, but coming back multiple times, clicking a CTA, or filling out a form starts to add up.**

You get a better sense of where someone stands based on how involved they are and what they focus on.

**Cursive tracks 450B+ monthly intent signals across 30,000+ categories**, helping you identify when prospects are actively researching solutions like yours.

## Ways to Group Audiences Using Intent

Segmentation based on behavior gives you an edge. Rather than tossing everyone into one big group, you can sort them into clearer categories.

These don't need to be complicated, but they should align with actions.

**Useful ways to group potential buyers:**

- **High-Intent Prospects:** Multiple pricing page visits, case study downloads, return visits within 7 days
- **Active Researchers:** Blog readers, guide downloaders, resource page visitors
- **Warm Engagers:** Email opens, ad clicks, webinar attendees
- **Cold Prospects:** Single visit, no engagement, long time since last interaction

Each group needs different messaging. High-intent prospects might appreciate a product demo. Active researchers might benefit from detailed case studies.

**Cursive's behavioral segmentation automatically groups visitors** by page views, return frequency, and engagement patterns—ensuring every message matches demonstrated intent.

## Use Intent Data to Time Your Outreach

Timing matters as much as what you say. The best message sent at the wrong time gets ignored.

Intent data helps you identify the right moment to reach out:

- **Immediate follow-up:** Pricing page visit or demo request
- **24-hour nurture:** Content download or webinar attendance
- **Weekly check-in:** Multiple return visits without conversion

**When you reach out while someone is actively researching, your message feels helpful instead of interruptive.**

Cursive's automation tools trigger campaigns based on real-time intent signals—whether it's a return visit, content download, or pricing page view—so you never miss a high-intent moment.

## Avoid Common Intent Segmentation Mistakes

It's easy to build segments that feel smart initially but lose accuracy over time.

**Common mistakes:**

- **Relying on old data:** Intent changes fast. Yesterday's high-intent prospect might have already chosen a competitor.
- **Segmenting too broadly:** "Visited website" isn't specific enough. Focus on high-value actions.
- **Ignoring negative signals:** Someone who visited once six months ago isn't the same as someone visiting daily this week.

**The fix: Pull updates often and adjust based on what people actually show you.**

Clear communication between tools and teams prevents messy messaging. If your email platform doesn't sync with your CRM, messages get disjointed.

Regular segmentation audits catch issues before they become bigger problems. Encourage feedback from people who work directly with your audience—sales and customer service teams often have insights you'd otherwise miss.

## Score Leads Based on Intent Signals

Not all intent signals carry equal weight. Build a scoring system that prioritizes high-value actions.

**Example scoring model:**

- Pricing page visit: +15 points
- Case study download: +10 points
- Email open: +5 points
- Blog read: +3 points
- Return visit within 7 days: +10 points

Set thresholds for sales-ready leads (e.g., 30+ points) and focus outreach there first.

**Cursive automatically scores leads based on behavioral signals and intent data**, routing high-scoring prospects to sales while nurturing lower-scoring contacts with targeted content.

## Turn Intent Signals Into Revenue

When you segment audiences based on real buyer intent, you're not guessing who might convert. You're targeting people showing clear buying signals.

**Results:**

- **Higher conversion rates:** Focus on prospects actively researching
- **Shorter sales cycles:** Reach out when they're ready to decide
- **Better resource allocation:** Spend time on qualified leads, not cold outreach

Intent-based segmentation transforms marketing from spray-and-pray to precision targeting.
