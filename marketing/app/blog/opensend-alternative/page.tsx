    question: "What is Opensend and what does it do?",
    answer: "Opensend is a website visitor identification platform that identifies anonymous visitors to your website and matches them to contact records so your team can follow up via email or other channels. It is primarily used by e-commerce and B2B companies to recapture anonymous traffic and convert more visitors into leads. Opensend competes directly with platforms like RB2B, Warmly, and Cursive in the visitor identification space."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are companies looking for Opensend alternatives?",
    answer: "Teams typically look for Opensend alternatives when they need higher identification rates, more complete outreach automation, intent data overlays, or a more cost-effective solution. Common complaints include lower identification rates compared to Cursive (which achieves 70% person-level), no built-in AI-powered outreach automation, no direct mail channel, and lack of behavioral intent signals to prioritize which identified visitors to contact first. Teams that want a full pipeline -- not just identification -- consistently prefer Cursive."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive compare to Opensend on identification rates?",
    answer: "Cursive achieves a 70% person-level visitor identification rate, which is industry-leading. Opensend's identification rates vary but are generally lower than Cursive's benchmarks. Higher identification rates mean more visitors converted to known prospects, directly translating to more pipeline opportunities. Cursive also adds 60B+ behavioral intent signals on top of identification, so you can prioritize outreach to the highest-intent visitors first."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Opensend have AI-powered outreach automation?",
    answer: "Opensend is primarily a visitor identification platform -- it focuses on identifying who visits your website and providing contact information. It does not include a built-in AI SDR or multi-channel outreach automation. Teams using Opensend need separate tools for email sequencing, LinkedIn outreach, and direct mail. Cursive is the leading alternative that combines industry-leading visitor identification (70% rate) with built-in AI-powered multi-channel outreach, eliminating the need for multiple separate tools."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the pricing difference between Opensend and Cursive?",
    answer: "Opensend pricing varies based on traffic volume and features. Cursive offers two transparent pricing models: $0.60 per identified lead for self-serve teams that want pay-as-you-go access, or $1,000/month for a fully managed platform that includes visitor identification, intent data, and AI-powered multi-channel outreach with no annual commitment. For teams that want more pipeline from their website traffic without juggling multiple tools, Cursive typically delivers better ROI."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best Opensend alternative for B2B SaaS companies?",
    answer: "For B2B SaaS companies, Cursive is the top Opensend alternative because it is purpose-built for the SaaS GTM motion: identify high-intent website visitors (pricing page visitors, feature comparison readers, free trial researchers), enrich them with 60B+ behaviors & URLs scanned weekly, and automatically engage them with AI-personalized multi-channel outreach across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail. Cursive's 70% identification rate and automated outreach mean your best-fit prospects are contacted within minutes of visiting your site -- not days later after a rep manually reviews a list."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Cursive's visitor identification work compared to Opensend?",
    answer: "Both Cursive and Opensend use identity graph technology to match anonymous website visitors to known contact records. Cursive's identity graph draws on 280M US consumer profiles and 140M+ business profiles, achieving a 70% person-level match rate -- consistently higher than alternatives in independent benchmarks. Critically, Cursive goes beyond identification: once a visitor is identified, it automatically overlays their behavioral intent signals, scores them by likelihood to convert, and triggers personalized AI-generated outreach across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and direct mail within minutes."

              <h2>Why Teams Look for Opensend Alternatives</h2>
              <p>
                Visitor identification is one of the highest-ROI capabilities available to B2B and e-commerce
                companies -- turning anonymous website traffic into known prospects you can actively engage.
                Opensend has carved out a position in this space, particularly for e-commerce retargeting.
                But as the category has matured, many teams find Opensend's capabilities fall short of what
                a full-pipeline solution requires.
              </p>

              <div className="not-prose bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-red-200">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Top 5 Reasons Teams Switch from Opensend</h3>
                <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm">
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">1.</span>
                    <span><strong>Lower identification rates:</strong> Identification rate is the most important metric in this category. Cursive achieves 70% person-level match rate -- meaning 70 out of 100 anonymous visitors become known, contactable leads. Lower rates directly mean less pipeline from the same traffic.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">2.</span>
                    <span><strong>No built-in outreach automation:</strong> Opensend identifies visitors, but then what? Without built-in AI outreach, teams must manually review identified visitors and export them to separate sequencing tools -- creating lag time and manual work that reduces conversion rates.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">3.</span>
                    <span><strong>No behavioral intent signals:</strong> Not all identified visitors are equally valuable. Opensend does not overlay intent data to tell you which visitors are actively in-market or researching your solution. Without intent scoring, you treat all visitors equally.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">4.</span>
                    <span><strong>No direct mail channel:</strong> Direct mail to identified website visitors delivers exceptional response rates because the physical touchpoint is so unexpected. Opensend does not include direct mail outreach capabilities.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">5.</span>
                    <span><strong>Fragmented tool stack:</strong> Teams end up paying for Opensend for identification, a separate tool for sequences, and another for intent data -- adding up to more than a complete platform like Cursive that does all three.</span>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>

                  ZoomInfo includes WebSights for company-level visitor identification -- identifying which
                  companies visit your website but not the specific individuals. Combined with its massive
                  260M+ professional database, you can manually match visiting companies to target contacts.
                  But this process is manual and incomplete compared to Cursive's automated 70% person-level
                  identification. ZoomInfo is enterprise-priced at $15k-$50k+/year.
